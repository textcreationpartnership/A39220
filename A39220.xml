            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou ſeeſt here the fruits of ſome ſpare hours: and of thoſe which might juſtly have been given to ſleep. My deſire is, that thou mayeſt read them in the ſame manner as I wrote them, that is, <hi>Relaxare animum,</hi> being tyred and wearied with more ſerious ſtudies, or weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affairs. By this means you ſhall neither tyre your ſelf, nor abuſe your time, uſing them for an innocent recreation. This is but the firſt part of the whole Work, and indeed but a kind of introduction to the reſt. This firſt appears as a Libament to your palate: if liked, it ſhall induce me to finiſh the reſt; if diſliked, I have already done too much, and ſhall deſiſt: For I am none of thoſe who dote upon their own fancies, and
<pb facs="tcp:51633:3"/> 
               <hi>Narciſſus-</hi>like, fall in love with the ſhadows of their own brain. I make you my Judges, and by your Votes I ſhall either proceed, or give off. Miſtake me not; I yield my ſelf not to the mercy and judgement of thoſe who are prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch writings in general, and count it a part of their Creed to abhor them, and whatever of good that appears under the title of a <hi>Romance.</hi> Theſe are not like the ingenious <hi>Bee,</hi> who ſucks honey out of the very weeds; nor like the good <hi>Chimick,</hi> who extracts the good, and leaves the bad; They fling all away in a lump, deſpiſe the book for the covers-ſake, and diſregard the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe the title do'nt pleaſe them. Theſe I ſay ſha'nt be my Judges, nor ſhall their bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings diſcourage my future proceedings, for they will be ſure to condemn all, though they never read a word: They will cry out, that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching, frothy, and apt to withdraw the mind of the Reader from graver ſtudies. But ſurely they are ignorant of the true ground and ſcope of theſe kind of Writings; which is to depaint vertue and vice in their natural and genuine colours, and to exhibit the fairneſs of the one, the foulneſs of the other, and the rewards of both. They know not that <hi>Romances</hi> are not alwayes farc'd with <hi>Love-ſtories</hi> and toyes, though thoſe are intertexted for delight, and that things <hi>Oeconomical, Ethethical, Phyſical, Metaphyſical, Philoſophycal, Political,</hi> and <hi>Theological</hi> as well as <hi>Amatory,</hi> may be, not unaptly, nor unfitly exhibited. The Divines
<pb facs="tcp:51633:3"/> will be angry if I tell them, that many have found that in a <hi>Romance,</hi> which hath induced them to be vertuous, and converted them from the leud actions of vice, which they could never find in their Sermons, though they weekly fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented their Oratory. The reaſon is, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades more pathetically than they can, a ſtory giving life to the words, and repreſenting it in lively colours, preſſeth it home upon the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, where it is ſcarcely delible. Neither do I ſubmit my ſelf to the Cenſure of thoſe <hi>Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Fellowes, who would find fault with the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> themſelves, or the Writings of <hi>Apollo.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs theſe will ſay, I never took a nap upon <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus,</hi> and that my pen was never dipt in the <hi>Heliconie</hi> fount. The beſt is, whilſt I am unknown, I can look over their ſhoulders, and hear their opprobries without paſſion; and ingaging my ſelf to anſwer their follies, I would have none to <hi>criticize</hi> or diſcant on any work, till themſelves have undergone the tryal of writing the like; for 'tis far eaſier to find fault, than to know how to amend it. I was of the ſame humour, and in reading the works of others, methought the moſt perfect ſeem'd ſometime lame, either in <hi>ſtile</hi> or <hi>ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> but in making tryal of my own invention, I well underſtand humane frailty, in a continued <hi>Series.</hi> I confeſs the judicious may find matter enough to increpate the Author juſtly, but the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> may carp, where there is no cauſe, for they
<pb facs="tcp:51633:4"/> moſt times find fault where there is leaſt need. As I much regard the cenſure of the one, ſo I very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle value the carping of the other. 'Tis thoſe Wits who have laid aſide that Mordacity, and who know how to diſtinguiſh betwixt the good and the bad, which I conſtitute for my Judges: With thoſe fair and wiſe ones of the <hi>female ſex,</hi> whoſe delight I chiefly aim'd at. If they find any thing that may content them, 'twill be inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration enough for higher, and better conceits, and will be the greateſt inducement for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of <hi>Eliana;</hi> but if they paſs hard cenſures upon this, th'le ſtrike dead all deſires of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Lora</hi> had new begun to ſpread her flowry-fragrant mantle upon the ſuperficies of the Earth, and to beſpangle the verdant graſs with her beauteous adornments, thereby inviting troubled Lovers to eaſe thoſe continual paſſions, which poſſeſs their amorous Souls, with the beholding the variety of her pleaſing and delightfull Objects. When the moſt paſſionate <hi>Angelois</hi> walking with a negligent pace, and deeply ruminating on his amorolis affairs, was entered into a grove, free from the frequentations of any beſides the ranging beaſts, and pleaſing birds, whoſe dulced Notes exulſcetated him out of his melancholy contemplations. Being well nigh in the midſt of that ſolitary place, he caſt his eyes upon a bank, which as if it had had ſome Soveranity over the reſt of the earth thereabouts, was more peculiarly crowned, with all ſorts of <hi>Sylvane</hi> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the graſs with a verdant luſtre ſeem'd a repoſe for a troubled ſoul. The Trees as if they had conſpir'd together to guard the place, from the ſcorching beams of <hi>Phaebus,</hi> grew ſo thick with intermixing branches, that it was impoſſible for him to peep on the beauty of the place, whilſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bowing their proud tops did homage to its luſtre. And that there might not want any thing which might conduce to its exuperancy, in quietude, beauty and pleaſure, there ran not far from its verges, a ſilver current, which having a ſmall diſcent, made a pleaſant murmur, with forcing its way over the pibbles, which oppoſed its quiet paſſage, which noiſe ſeemed a baſe to the ſweet trebles of the pretty birds, who pearcht one every branch made a moſt harmonious noiſe. <hi>Argelois</hi> ſeeing this place ſo agreeable to the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his mind, that he might more freely conſider its beauty, he caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon that delightfull bank, being under the thickeſt covert in the grove,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51633:5"/> and letting his fancy for a ſpace be carried about with theſe pleaſing objects, he lay beholding the beauty of the place, and liſtning to the pleaſant notes of thoſe wood Choreſters, whereby his ſenſes with the pleaſure were rapt into a ſweet repoſe, and for a ſeaſon gave ſome eaſe to thoſe inquietudes that poſſeſt his amorous breaſt. But at laſt, remaining in that kind of ſtupidity, he was aſſaulted by a violent ruſhing in of thoſe paſſions which had through that ſmall repoſe received ſome ſtop to their wonted current, but then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing the banks of his ſilence, he uttered to the ſenſeleſs trees, that which his breaſt was too weak to contain. <q rend="margQuotes">"Ah cruel and unſupportable flames, ſaid he, that neither danger nor diſtreſs can quench, what torments put you my ſoul to! what cruelty do you exerciſe on a ſoul, who ſo much adores your Deities, and hath your power in ſo great veneration, that it endures thoſe pains you inſlict without the leaſt murmuring. Why exerciſe you not your cruelty on thoſe who oppoſe your regency; and make them feel the heat of your penetrating flames? Ah! no, thoſe polluted ſouls are not worthy your viſitation, nor their defiled breaſts capable of receiving your ſacred fires. Seeing it is an honour to die by the hands of love, I ſhall deſire not to be freed its bonds, but quickly to receive a welcome death, for thus to live in continual torture is more than mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It ſeems to me ſometimes better to die than to live, and ſometimes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to live than die: ſometimes I pray for the one, ſometimes for the other. But O you powers which rule us Mortals, What need I ſigh out my miſery to you, when you know and are the Cauſers of it? Surely not for my diſobedience, but that I may know your power. Ah! I muſt be content for ever to endure this torment, which yet no other ever knew, becauſe hope is wanting. I am like one who admires the Sun, but may never reach him. I love an object, more requiſite for the gods than man, much leſs I who know not whence I am, nor by what fortune I came into the world: How dare I then aſpire to ſerve a Princeſs ſo far beyond my reach? I muſt blame ye Deities for binding me with an infragible chain, ſo that it is not poſſible for me to live, and not love <hi>Eliana,</hi> whoſe very name tranſportes me. Love her! I cannot chuſe that, that I muſt do, admire and adore her. O Heavens me thinks I find ſome ſparks of a generous ſoul which tells me, I am not form'd out of the common earth of <hi>Plebians.</hi> May your Divinities make known my ſtock, and that may extricate me from this Labrinth of love and confuſion; or elſe with my life, end my miſery.

               <p>Sir, accidentally hearing the complaints of your too amorous ſoul, and I know not by what power, feeling your torments ſtirring up a pitty and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity together in my breaſt, I have thus rudely adventured to approach you, and alſo out of a deſire I have, prompted by a more than ordinary violence, to enter a diſcourſe with you, and if it might be to ſhew you the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Tyrannous love by too many experimented Tryals.

The exerciſe of theſe employments took up my age of puberty, and having been well grounded in both, I deſired to make uſe of my armes abroad, but my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents denying me ſo dangerous an imployment, I was conſtrained to abide under their indulgent wings, being the joy and comfort of their old age. I had ſcarce attained ſeventeen years, when to my grief my mother departed into the <hi>Subterranean</hi> walks of the <hi>Stigean</hi> grove, and before two years more had paſſed, my father ran the like fortune, being ſuddenly ſtruck by the hand of the inexorable <hi>Parca.</hi> My father ſeeing a ſtayedneſſe in me, which was not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uſual to ſuch young years, left me ſole Gardian to my ſelf, and with his death ſurrendred up thoſe poſſeſſions which were ſufficiently great. Some time I ſpent in juſt tears for my parents loſſe, till time had conſumed the moiſture of my eyes, and wore away the ſadneſſe from my heart, then having the reines in my own hand I purpoſed to put thoſe reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions into act, which the indulgency of my parents had deterr'd. For which end, having two Uncles, one the brother of my father, the other of my mother, I deſired them to look to my eſtate at home, whileſt I ſought renown abroad; I made known my deſires, and urg'd them to grant my requeſt, they endeavoured to diſſwade me, but in vain, which ſeeing, they promiſed (to my joy) to fulfil my deſires. The eldeſt ſon of my fathers brother named <hi>Araterus</hi> knowing my reſolutions, with great importunings got both my leave and his fathers to accompany me. Having ſpent ſome time in furniſhing our ſelves with what we wanted, we departed from our own Countrey of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> having none in our company but a faithful ſervant of my own named <hi>Meador.</hi> Having furniſhed our ſelves with a ſhip at <hi>Tarſus,</hi> with a proſperous winde we failed along the <hi>Tyrrhenean</hi> ſea, and for that our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires extended beyond the limits of an ordinary travel, we were reſolved to paſs into the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, and to view the utmoſt limits of the Romane Empire, and ſo returning at leaſure, view the places of more fame. This our reſolution carried us beyond <hi>Herculus</hi>'s pillars, and paſſing the ſtreight, we entred into that vaſt and ſpacious ſea, which beats upon the coaſt of the <hi>Iberians.</hi> The winde as it were repenting his former kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, on a ſudden began to riſe, and <hi>Boreas</hi> with a full gale oppos'd out prow, making <hi>Neptunes</hi> watry ſurges bear the ſhip aloft, mounting it ſo high on thoſe liquid rocks, that it might receive the more dangerous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiet: we endeavoured to gain the ſhore, but a contrary winde, contraried our deſign, and in ſpight of all our endeavours carried us far into the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, where we ran every moment the danger of death, and to aggravate our miſeries, a dark and pitchy night overtook us, with the continual aſſaults of this furious tempeſt againſt our floating Caſtle, which ſometimes had almoſt yielded to the battery of the winds, having ſo unſteady a foundation as the waters. When we perceived our endeavours to ſave the ſhip and our ſelves were vain, we committed our ſelves wholly to the protection of the Gods, and let the ſhip follow the fortune of the waters, being carried along with the impetuous blaſts of the enraged wind. The night ſo dark that we could not ſee our own deaths, nor the imminent danger we were in, at laſt vaded, the wiſht for day appearing, but with a troubled skie, clouds accumelating with that craſſitude, as if in deſpight of the Sun they would tranſvert the day into night. The winde having this day and the enſuing night vented its fury, began to diminiſh its rage of its ſelf, or the gods pitying our condition, gave a countermand to the encounters of the inferiour windy and watry Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. At laſt our weather beaten ſhip, and both affrighted and tyred Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were driven upon the coaſts of a ſmall and unknown Iſland, joyful we had eſcaped this danger, we deſired to eaſe our ſelves on the Land, and there

Some of us paſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iſland in a boat, which we had for the like occaſions, whileſt the others remained in the ſhip.

Not knowing what dangers might occur, we put on our armour, and with <hi>Meador</hi> (my ſervant) paſſed into the Iſland: We intended not to go far, becauſe the evening approached, but entring a walk beſet with green fair-ſpread trees, by the ſide of a ſmall clear rivulet, which with a gentle murmur haſted into a bigger river, which carried it as a tribute to the Ocean, we had paſſed farther then we were aware of, the pleaſantneſs of the walk ſtealing away our denotation of the time. The end of this walk conveyed us into a moſt dilectable grove, in the which was the moſt pleaſing walks that might be, a place as we thought conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Diana</hi> and her nimphs.

We were now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to return, finding it already night in that obumbrated place, when we found the muſings we had entertain'd had made us loſe our Judgments for return, the path that brought us into this Labyrinth could not be retrod, though ſearched by the memory of us all, and the more we thought to extricate our ſelves, the more were we intangled in this <hi>Dedalian</hi> Grove.</p>
                  <p>Seeing neceſſity cauſed our ſtay, and that our hopes for departure were aboliſht, we left retriving the path, to ſeek ſome convenient repoſe, hoping the next Sun would accommodate us with light to finde that which then we ſought in vain. I had many times pitcht upon places for our repoſe, and as often (through my unſettled thoughts) rejected them. Thinking to find ſome better than the laſt I had pitcht on, I made a further ſearch into a place thicker than all the reſt; entring the place I eſpied a large Cave, the entrance being paved with moſſe. This place I thought moſt convenient to ſhelter us from any annoyance of the heavens. The entrance was impleat with a ſilent darkneſſe, and with a little diſcent; we went but few paces within the mouth leaſt we might precipitate our ſelves in that obſcure place. We ſoon betook our ſelves to enjoy that reſt, which nature requires, and of which through our danger at ſea, we had been much deprived. <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi> and my ſervant had ſoon entred their living death, whileſt my ageta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoughts had kept open the windows of my ſenſes. But endeavouring to ſuppreſs the motions of my minde, I heard certain emotions within the Cave, which gave a check to my thoughts and a ſtop to my deſire of ſleep, and attending what might enſue, I perceived the noiſe to approach, and ſuddenly felt ſome blows which I could not ſee acted, becauſe of the obſcurity of the place. This engaged me to riſe, and with my ſword to defend my ſelf, the noiſe I made in ſtriking (which light on nothing but the ſides or ground of the Cave) awaked <hi>Araterus,</hi> who half amazed, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed at being ſo ſuddenly awaked, had like to have offended me more then my unſeen adverſaries, for hearing our blowes, he engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the dark, and with a forcible blow a little wounded my head, I made
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51633:7"/> known to him his unſeene perpetration, and gained him to retire, leaving me to defend my ſelfe from the unſeene blowes of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known adverſaries. I wondred, when feeling their blows, they cut not, nor ſtruck as if in the hands of a weaponiſt, and ſo conſuſedly both behind and before, as if I had dealt with many adverſaries, that I knew not how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my ſelf, nor offend them, for my blows, though ſtruck every way, could never be faſtned on any, beſides none anſwering to my demands, made me begin to think them ſome <hi>Phantaſmes,</hi> or ſome unknown terene Deities which inhabited the Iſland, theſe thoughts made me retire to the mouth of the Cave, and not being purſued, I would not enter to diſturb the ſacred. <hi>Araterus</hi> had for the wound he had given me, applied ſome drogue which he uſually carried about him. After this diſturbance we took up our lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the very mouth of the Cave, and not truſting to my imagination, one of us watcht whileſt the other ſlept, and in this ſort we ſpent the night. Aſſoon as the day began fairly to diſplay it ſelf, we aroſe, and reſolving to ſee whither my thoughts of thoſe <hi>Phantaſmes</hi> were true conceptions, we entred the Cave, and the light demonſtrated the wounds I had given the earth where I had that ſtrange combat.</p>
                  <p>But paſſing farther we came into a four quare room arched with ſtone, and in the middle of it a Tomb, more fair then rich, with a certain inſcription which we could not underſtand, our perqueſtions could find no creature that might give us any light into theſe novils, which made us depart, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unſatisfied. It was not without trouble that we found the path which led us to the place where we left our boat, but arriving there we found, that both the ſhip and it were departed: we could not conjecture why they left us, except they thought we were devoured by wild beaſts or ſome other accident had hapned us becauſe we ſtayed. We ſaw our caſe was deſperate, in that we were left upon an Iſland where we knew not that any came, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept driven by the like chance as our ſelves, and where was neither beaſts, nor fruit that might ſerve for food, unleſs ſome certain nuts which we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpied in the Grove. But for that we ſaw no help, we forced our ſelves to a generous patience, traverſing the ſhore, if happily we might ſee any veſſel which might tranſport us thence. Two dayes and two nights paſſed, and not the leaſt hope appeared to our ſight, the next day wandring upon the ſea with our eyes; we beheld ſomething like a ſmall boat floating upon the ſea, the calm which ſucceded the laſt ſtorm was great, but a gentle <hi>Zepherus</hi> curling the face of the ſea brought that which we had ſeen into more perfect view, which then we ſaw to be a cheſt, which we judged to proceed from ſome naufrage in this laſt ſtorm. The wind and the gentle moving of the water at laſt caſt this cheſt on the ſhore, not farre from the place where we were, which moved us to ſee what it might contain, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to find ſomething that might preſerve our lives, for the diſtreſs we were in for lack of food made all our thoughts run on nothing elſe, but with ſome labour and difficulty having gotten it out of the water, I lifted up the lid and beheld a ſad object of pity, which was a very young child in rich ſwadling cloaths, as I thought dead, but at laſt I perceived it breath, and ſaw that ſleep had only preſerv'd its life. The diſtreſs of this tender infant had utterly taken away the thought of our own, and now our prayers and our tears call'd the gods to the help of none but it. I took it up in my arms and ſaw it was a boy, which by the face and the rich cloaths which wrapt him, we judged to be the off-ſpring of no mean parents. I do not know I ever felt the like pity as then, to ſee a child per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted ſo ſoon, by the hand of fortune, and having run ſo great a danger at ſea, muſt alſo run the hazard of being ſtarved on land. The lovely looks of this tender infant, with the pretty ſmiles it made, cauſ'd ſo great a ruth in my ſoul, that not enduring the ſight of ſo pitiful an object, I cloſed it in its tomb, I knew not how to preſerve it alive, having no food to give it, or our ſelves; therefore I thought it muſt inevitably periſh.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51633:8"/>
                  <p> The next day <hi>Araterus</hi> and <hi>Meador</hi> leaving me alone with the ſea-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved infant, went into the grove to gather ſome Nuts which we had eſpied there, to ſuſtain us from periſhing, and to preſerve our lives for greater misfortunes. Being alone I uttered my complaints and prayers to the gods to help us from that deſolate place, complaining on that conſtant inconſtant Deity, attributing our misfortune to her perpetration. and our preſervation to the more mercifull gods. In the midſt of my cogitations, that the ſhare the gods had in my preſervation might appear, I eſpied a good tall ſhip paſs not far from the Iſland. I loſt not the opportunity, but with a ſtrained voice, and many ſignes called them to my delivery; what with the one and with the other, they eſpied me, preſently I ſaw they made towards the Iſland, and fill'd their ſhip boat with their armed men. I was about to implore their aid, but on a ſudden they let me know that they intended to force me to that which I had intended to deſire of them, and with their Armes and multitude made me their priſoner. Indeed I had little mind to reſiſt, being willing to be ſhifted from that imminent danger I was then in, though I fell into another as great, I endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to ſtay for <hi>Araterus</hi> my Cozen, and to take that booty too ſince they accompted me ſo, but nothing would prevail with thoſe unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men, neither of intreaty, nor in pitty, but left him expoſed to an unqueſtionable ſtarving. I accounted this incounter rather for the ſake of the infant than of me, ſince I left there my heart, with my diſtreſſed Cozen of whom afterward I never heard tidings. The Cheſt being gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily preſerv'd out of hope of Treaſure (for their haſt gave them not liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to look into it) was carried with my ſelf priſoner to their ſhip.</p>
                  <p>My eyes were ſtill fixed on the ſhore, and no deportments could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them thence, till the ſhip wherein I was inſenſibly had carried me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the view of that triſtfull remembrancer, yet could it not depart me from that ſorrow, our unhappy disjunction had caus'd, and though I had loſt the viſible ſight of the Iſle, yet my imagination repreſented me there, as a partaker of <hi>Araterus</hi>'s miſeries. My muſings at laſt were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, by the remembrance of the child, whoſe ſafety conſiſted in my help, after they had ſeen that their prize was not ſo conſiderable as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, I perſwaded the Chief with all the Oratory I had, to let the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant be preſerv'd, whom the more cruel would have flung over-board: what the floting-houſe could afford, I procured for the Infant, though ſcarce fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for ſo tender a Pallate, but neceſſity conſtrain'd me to adminiſter ſuch as I could get, and that with the gods help ſav'd its life. We had faild two days when we eſpi'd a tall ſhip before the wind, to whom theſe Pirats that had made me Priſoner made up, thinking that ſhe had been prize, but they found this ſhip full of armed men that met them with ſo much reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs they expected not, that they would have disingaged themſelves, but could not; we were at laſt after great ſlaughter of their men taken and made priſoners anew, but as it happened to better Maſters.</p>
                  <p>After they had diſcarded the Pirats veſſel, I was made known to the Chief of the other to be none of them, and had all the civility could be ask'd ſhew'd me by that generous Chief, who at my requeſt had a great care on the infant, I with ſo much care regarded, having by ſo ſtrange a fortune acquired it. I gave him the knowledge of my name which is <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes,</hi> and of my adventure at the diſſolate Iſland, and asking ſo him what he knew of that place, he told me, that he had no other knowledge than by relation from others, which was, that many had endeavoured to inhabit there, but were moleſted in the night with apparitions of ſpirits, and with unſupportable blows were driven thence, the cauſe (as he heard) was that a man who inhabited that Iſle, being a famous <hi>Druide,</hi> and having

The more we were acquainted, the more grew our friendſhip, and the more I perceived his good diſpoſition: I found him to harbour not a ſeeming, but a true and generous amity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring rather in deeds than in words to expreſs his generoſity. I found a great relaxation in his converſation, and a ſweet engagement in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, ſo that being familiarly acquainted with him in ſome ſhort time, he gave me an accompt what he was, and of the enterpriſe he was then going about, which becauſe it is delightfull, and that you have given your ſelf up to hear theſe ſtories of loves follies, I ſhall relate as near as I can to the form he gave it me in.

She made me be born a Prince, ſo bred me up, and (till of late) in all the courſe of my life gave me no cauſe to complain. But when that I aſſured my ſelf to be her fortunate darling, ſhe precipitated me from the top of her moving wheel, and conſpiring with love to ruine me, turned her ſmiles into frowns.

One evening as I was walking by the ſide of a grove, I had caſt my eyes ſuddenly on an Object, which as ſuddenly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized me, it was a Lady of incomparable beauty, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who with a ſad aſpect ſeem'd to reſt her ſelf under the tree's um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage. This ſight brought at firſt a kind of ſhivering, but afterwards a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into my breaſt, ſo that I being unacquainted with this diſturbance, thought the Lady to be of the nature of the <hi>Baſilisk</hi> who delates her poiſon through the eyes. But though I felt my ſelf wounded by my ſight, yet could I not withdraw my eyes from ſo lovely an object, till I had diſcovered my ſelf. I then rendring her the courteſies which belonged to civility, made bold to enquire the cauſe of that ſad and ſolitary encounter in a place ſo dangerous and ſubject to rapines, with all offering her my ſelf and caſtle for her protection; She anſwered me, that ſolitude was conſonant to her deſires, and that ſhe had deſerted others to be left alone. But I ſtill preſſed her to accept of my protection and civility, giving her the knowledge of whom <hi>I</hi> was, and uſing all the perſwaſive Arguments I was capable of giving, which at laſt wrought upon her for an acceptance. Whilſt with a ſoftly pace we moved towards my Caſtle: <hi>I</hi> told her that my deſires were great to know who ſhe was, not ſo much out of curioſity, as to know if any way the ſmall power I had, could render me any way ſerviceable to her, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting by many words the great deſire I had to de her ſervice. She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me, that all the ſervices that could be rendred her, could do her no good, nothing but death alone was able to help her, but ſhe added, that hitherto ſhe had found no opportunity, though ſought, to accompliſh her deſires, and that therefore ſhe expected nothing now, but a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of her miſeries.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:51633:9"/>
                  <p> This preſſed me to a further enquiry, to know the cauſe of this affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which thus depreſſed her, and though I uttered my inquiſitions with many circumlocutions, becauſe I would not ſeem ſo boldly to intrude, yet ſhe perceived my deſires, and to ſatisfie me, ſhe ſaid thus. Leſt you ſhould have any ſiniſter opinion of me, whereby you may ſtain my honour in your thoughts, I ſhall freely declare who I am, and the occaſion of my being unaccompanied, although in ſo doing I ſhall diſcover the frailty and almoſt impudicity of my actions conſtrained by a paſſion which ſome call Love. Before ſhe proceeded I beſeecht her not to conceive me guilty of ſuch a crime, as to think any thing but vertue harbored in ſo delicate a veſſel, proteſting that my thoughts had not had the leaſt intimation of any thing, but what was agreeable to vertue and honour. She replyed how that it could not be termed a crime, if that I had conceived any maleopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of her, ſeeing that a juſt occaſion had ſprung from her encounter, and ſeeing that I had rendred ſo great a teſtification of the purity of my thoughts by my actions, ſhe could not without running the hazard of ingratitude, ſuffer me to remain in ignorance concerning her ſelf, and as with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhe had truſted me with her honour, ſo without fear ſhe might relate the preceeding actions of her life. After I had given her an aſſurance of my fidelity both for the one as the other, ſhe proceeded thus.</p>
                  <p>Love is a paſſion, which differently poſſeſſes ſouls, and with a different fire conſumes our vitals, if harbored in an immaculate breaſt, and reanſwered by the object beloved with as pure flames, there is no content, joy or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, like to the ſcorching influences proceeding from each other, whereby they communicate the very eſſence of their love, with as pure breathings as the ſacred Deities; the thoughts of ſo great a happineſs hath oft times car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me into an extaſie, what then would be the fruition? My deſires have been as chaſt, and flames as pure, but that naked and blind deity hath fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally croſt me, which makes me love with ſo much anxiety and torment: For Love not regarded, and not meeting with the deſired flames, feeds on the life of the Lover, and it may be hath cauſed that <hi>Simile</hi> which compares love to the continual feeding Eagle on the liver of <hi>Tityus,</hi> which renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes him ſuffer continual unſufferable torment, ſo that the preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of pain may be aſcribed to it. We ſee that thoſe who feel and ſuffer extream pains to do and ſpeak that, which they would not, were they not in that pain-forced frency: So often-times Lovers through the great vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anxiety which they feel through the oppoſition of their Loves, do moſt extravagant actions, and women ſometimes vary beyond the pudicity of their ſex. This I bring as a Prologue for a favorable conſtruction of thoſe actions in my relation which may ſeem to paſs the bounds of womanly pudicity. But briefly (proceeded ſhe) to give you an account of my life it is this.</p>
                  <p>My name is <hi>Floria,</hi> and I am the ſole daughter of the great Lord of the <hi>Santones</hi> on the other ſide of the river <hi>Ligeris,</hi> where till Love oppreſſed me, I lived with as great content as pleaſure; but it fortuned that I was touched with its dart, ſince which I never well enjoyed my liberty, but of late more furious have been the aſſaults, the more they were deſpiſed by that cruel one the cauſe of my miſery. The Object of this paſſion (not to hide any thing from you) is <hi>Subelta</hi> Lord of the <hi>Redones,</hi> one as valiant as cruel. We were acquainted ſometime before this Tyrant took poſſeſſion of my ſoul, and by his jovial Court-ſhip was I brought firſt to a likeing, and afterwards to a violent love, which forced me to expreſs ſome ſmall ſignes thereof, yet never tranſgreſſing the Lawes of modeſty. He (cruel wretch!) ſoon perceived it, and as ſoon ſlighted my innocent affections, oftentimes deſpiſing that company, which before he had ſo much ſought. He had no
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51633:9"/> other reaſon for this but his own opinion, which was he accounted it, an extream folly for any to yield to ſo ſottiſh a paſſion as Love, openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing and ſpeaking ſcoffingly of that Deity. In this budding of my Love hapned that which might have deracinated it, had it not been too deeply grounded, for my father being oppreſſed by <hi>Caelius a Roman</hi> Captain, I was given to him to be ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> as a hoſtage for my fathers obedience. I muſt confeſs I parted not from my father with ſo much regret as from <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a,</hi> and the thoughts for him made my journey unpleaſant. I was had to that ſtately City the Miſtreſs of the Univerſe, and by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to wait on <hi>Julia</hi> his daughter, a place nothing diſhonourable. The ſtatelyneſs of the place, the pomp of the Court, the daily converſe with the great ones, and the tender of ſervices could not divert the paſſions I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for <hi>Subelta.</hi> I rendred my ſelf acceptable to <hi>Julia,</hi> and with my obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience gain'd her good liking. But though I ſerved her with all willing duty, yet ſhe obſerved a more than ordinary ſadneſs ſtill accompany me. One day ſhe ſaid (thinking it was becauſe I was given in hoſtage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained as a Captive) that ſhe had wondred at my ſadneſs more than others, for ſhe thought I had been there long enough to forget my home, and that there were many of my condition, who counted their exchange the happieſt thing that could betide them, in coming to a place where they might learn that which naturally they had not, leaving their Barbariſm for Civility, and but then living like humane Creatures, but ſhe ſaid, if that it grieved me to ſerve her, ſhe would releaſe me, or if it was becauſe I remained in the condition of a ſlave, ſhe would get <hi>Caeſar</hi> to free me, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me to tell her truly the cauſe of my trouble, and not to doubt of her aſſiſtance. I ſeeing ſo great gentleneſs in the Princeſs, thanking the gods for that occaſion fell upon my knees, and not without tears told her that it was not my captivity that cauſed my ſadneſs, nor in that I was her ſervant, which I accounted the greateſt bliſs, yet ſeeing ſhe had charged me to let her know the cauſe of my trouble I told her the truth. My words and my tears were ſo effectual, that ſhe told me, although ſhe greatly deſired my company, yet ſhe would rather ſhew her affection in pleaſuring me than in contenting her ſelf. I beſeecht her not to oblige me with ſo many favours, for if ſhe did, ſhe would cauſe me endure a perpetual miſery in parting from ſo benign a Princeſs. Within a ſhort time after, ſhe told me, ſhe had gaind <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s leave for my departure, on condition, my father would give him other hoſtages. I made no queſtion but to redeem me he would have given half his <hi>Signory.</hi> I ſent him word of <hi>Caeſars</hi> will, deſiring him to feſtinate thoſe who ſhould ſupply my place: He moved with a fatherly love, uſed ſuch ſpeed that they arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> before I could expect them. Leaving thoſe my father ſent as a deſpoſitum for my fathers faith, in my place. I with great celerity haſtened from <hi>Rome,</hi> once more viſiting my native Countrey, but my chiefeſt joy was, that it harboured ungratefull <hi>Subelta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many of my friends viſited me after my return, and <hi>Subelta</hi> among the reſt, deſiring to know the rarities of that ſtately place which I had deſerted for his ſake. I quickly left others company to enjoy his, and no joy or content was like to that when I thought I could pleaſure him in my relations, of the City, the Court, the polity of the Courtiers, the behaviour of the Citizens, the Royalty of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and the magnitude and ſtatelyneſs of the City, Temples and Palaces, ſpinning out my relations to lengthen the time, that I might enjoy his preſence. But this content that I gave my ſelf, did but more ardently ſufflate that ſpark which remained in my breaſt, and inkindled a more violent flame, which ever ſince hath conſumed my heart. That which tormented my ſoul was that I ſaw he remained in his former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durateneſs,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51633:10"/> and extreamly ſlighted me, which ſo pinched my heart, that it put me into a grievous ſickneſs. She to whom I had uſed to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate my ſecrets, was ignorant of this, but perceiving ſomething beſides a natural ſickneſſe, conjur'd me to let her know what I ailed. Hoping the diſcovery might give ſome vent to my paſſions, I related to her (under the ſeal of ſilence) the torments I endured. She comforted me, and to quiet me promiſed much. But ſickneſs encreaſing, I was forced to write to <hi>Subelia</hi> declaring with as much modeſty as ſincerity, the great affliction I conceiv'd for thoſe ſlightings he had made of my favours, and the true and affectionate Love I bore him. To this Letter which was conveyed to him by one I could truſt with ſuch a ſecret, he would return no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but a perverſe obſtinacy in his ſlights. The relation of this had almoſt put a period to my life, and happy had I been if it had been the laſt exigent thereof, but the gods have prolong'd it for future ſhame and miſeries. I know not what Fate attends me, but all that ever I could do, could not overcome a paſſion ſo firmly fix'd in my mind, nor all his ſlightings and contumelies leſſen the immoderate affection I bore him; ſo that the anxity of my mind, and indiſpoſition of my body, bad ſo heightned my diſeaſe, that every one looked for my death, and it was much wiſhed for by my ſelf. But ſee the juſtice of the gods who heard my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and avenged my trouble, for whilſt I thus languiſhed, that deity whom he had ſo ſcoſſingly derided ſtruck him with a leaden Dart, and made him dote on <hi>Arteſa,</hi> a great mans daughter of the <hi>Santones,</hi> who as ſhe was inferiour to me in birth, ſo (by others judgement) in beauty. Here he was repay'd in his own coyn, and as he had dealt with me, ſhe prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by divine vengeance handl'd him. When I heard of this viciſſitude of fortune, my ſoul was mixt both with joy and grief. I rejoyced that he might know what Love was, and that he might be ſenſible of thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he had caus'd me to endure; but I was troubled that he ſuffered any pain, and that torment ſhould touch the thing I Lov'd; for Love is of that nature, that it cannot conſent to ſee the object beloved to endure any affliction, though it ſuffers by it the greateſt deſpight. Had my love abated, or had hatred poſſeſt its place, then had I gone to have effected ſome precipitation againſt him, and with vigor to avenge his injuries.</p>
                  <p>But I ſtill perſiſted in my paſſion for him, though he perſiſted in his hatred to me, but my ſickneſs brought be at laſt to the very point of death, which exigent ſomething diminiſhed thoſe flames for <hi>Subelta,</hi> and by the paine and torment I felt from the outward indiſpoſition of my body, I thought them quite exſtinguiſhed, ſo that helping to overcome my ſelf, I baniſht him from my thoughts, and ſought to obliterate him within my breaſt, and at laſt I found a great relaxation of my pain, for the cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, the effects ſoon ceaſed. Recovering by little and little to the great joy of my father and friends, and no leſs to my ſelf in that I had ſhaken off ſo powerful an enemy to my repoſe, I began to receive my former ſtrength and to go abroad. I had no ſooner recovered that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor which formerly accompanied me, but I began to feel a little glowing and reviving of that fire. I thought had been extinguiſhed, which now I ſaw was but raked under the aſhes, and at the leaſt mention of his name, it was ready to catch hold on ſomething that would have annoyed my reſt.</p>
                  <p>When I perceived the floods of ſorrow had not quencht, nor my conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual torment extinguiſht that ſpark, which lay raked up in the aſhes of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and now began to be afflated by a new breath from Love, renuing my complaints I gave my ſelf up a ſacrifice for his Altar, and in a ſhort time that flagrant ſpark enkindled by deſire, poſſeſt every corner of my heart
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51633:10"/> with its aſcending flames, and this relapſe came with a more violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the firſt aſſault; before with a tormented patience I ſunk under the burthen, and with a contiual grief almoſt diſpoſſeſt my ſelf of life, but now agitated by a more violentick humour, I ſought furibundouſly more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red precipitations. For as the relapſe is alwayes more dangerous than the firſt falling into the diſeaſe, ſo was this ſecond paſſion more likely to overwhelm me. Seeing therefore an aſſured torment, and a continual pain without the fruition of that, which I was never like to enjoy, I contracted a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with my ſelf, correſpond to ſo violent a paſſion, as well to free my ſelf from miſery, as to let <hi>Subelta</hi> ſee how farre the force of Love had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me.</p>
                  <p>This determination paſſed not the portals of my lips, but with a new reſolution I deſired to act this <hi>Tragedy</hi> in <hi>Subelta</hi>'s preſence, being thus hurried along with theſe violent motions, I ſtudied nothing but how to effect my purpoſed precipitation; Hiding from my faithful ſervant the chief of my purpoſe, with many words I told her the deſire I had to ſee <hi>Subelta,</hi> whereby I might give great eaſe to my perturbed breaſt, by pouring out thoſe complaints againſt him, which I had prepared for the like occaſion, telling her that I perſwaded my ſelf that (words being uttered from a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo reſenting, were more powerful than dead letters) the effects would anſwer my hopes, but if it wrought not on <hi>Subelta,</hi> yet it would be a great relaxation to my mind, in that I had vented that which ſo much troubled my repoſe, hoping if that took no effect, I might have power (ſeeing the impoſſibility, and his ingratitude) to overcome my ſelf, and to cede to the will of the gods. With other words powerful enough to gain her to that which ſhe hoped might conduce to my quiet, I charm'd her to my motion, and anſwered her to the objections ſhe made concerning the difficulty, and my honour. I had contrived before how to effect my deſign, and to eſcape with a good colour to ſave my reputation. I told her how I would deſire my father for my healths ſake to convey me to a place where I was brought up in my youth, and had took great delight in, hoping that the change of the aire might be a means to recover my health, and how that by the way I would find means to get from thoſe who ſhould accompany me, and that at my return I would contrive a ſtory of my rape without miſtruſt. Theſe things I told her, and what Love had infuſed into me, or rather the great deſire I had to perpetrate that action I intended; ſo that ſeeing my reſolutions were not to be beaten off, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to auxiliate me in my enterprize, not piercing to the bottom of my deſign.</p>
                  <p>It now remained that my feigned deſires were known to my father, which were as ſoon granted as heard by him, little imagining my intentions. At laſt I was ſent to this place well accoutred, with a ſpecial guard to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure my perſon from any rape, which were frequently committed by the <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers diſperſed through the Countrey. I knew it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to eſcape from the Caſtle whither I was going, to go to <hi>Subelta;</hi> therefore as I had before concluded, in our journey paſſing through a very thick wood we made an hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and letting my Troop paſs gently on, commanded none to ſtay with me but my confident, by which means we had a fine opportunity to eſcape, which without their ſuſpition we effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, directing our courſe a croſs the wood, with ſuch a ſpeed as my deſire could wiſh, entring the moſt intricate places of the Wood, which being ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hid us from our ſearchers, and the obſcurity of the night approaching gave us more confidence in our clandeſtine ſlight. Having almoſt wearied our horſes, and our ſelves, not uſed to ſuch hard ſervice, we reſolved to repoſe in ſome convenient place in the Wood, imagining our ſelves far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51633:11"/> from our Indagators, and eſpying a large Cave we reſolved to lodge there. But Fortune who purſu'd me faſter then thoſe who I know condol'd my loſs, and as a quick-ſented blood-hound catcht us when we leaſt ſuſpected, for not conſidering the dangerous <hi>Animals</hi> which thoſe ſpacious Woods harbour'd, we caſt our ſelves into the very lodging of a furious Lion: My maid was no ſooner alighted then aſſaulted, by the King of beaſts, whoſe great ſtrength ſo ſoon tare her weak corps, that ſhe had no time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider by what enemie ſhe died. This miſerable ſpectacle, fill'd me with a grief unexpreſſable, which took away the ſenſe of my own danger, and as if I had been able to have reveng'd the death of that miſerable creature, upon that Robuſt animal, I drew out a dagger which I had hid in my ſleeve, to have effected a more bloody perpetration againſt my ſelf, and with that ſmall vigor I poſſeſt, flung it againſt the ſhaggy beaſt, which being well cuſpidated to facilitate my own ruine, made a ſmall entrance into his ſide, which ſo enraged this furious creature, that leaving the miſerable carcaſe, he made at me, who deſired rather to periſh than live in ſo much miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But my horſe fearful of his approach, by running away ſav'd my life with its own, carrying me like a liveleſs ſtatue upon his back, environ'd with ſo much miſery, that I thought death a ſweeter companion. The night which was fully entred into the darke ſhades of the wood, with the concuſſion of the leavie boughs, and the ugly noiſe of thoſe <hi>Nocturnal</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which echoed through the Wood, and my ſolitude with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the late bloody ſpectacle I had beheld, caſt me into ſo great an agony, heightned by the frailty of my ſex, that you may better imagine than I relate. My horſe having the liberty of his head, carried me all night up and down the Wood, not being contradicted with the leaſt check of the reine, ſo that in the morning (whoſe approach had ſo often been wiſht for) I found my ſelf on the outſide of the Wood, and happily meeting with a ſhepheard, I deſired the liberty of his houſe, to repoſe my perturbed mind, and reſt my defatigated limbs, which hy the beſt of mettals I procur'd. The encounter of my thoughts diſturbed the reſt of my body, and the agitation of mind took away the deſire of ſleep. But as the noiſe of the waters lulls one to ſleep, ſo the commotions of theſe inward billows at laſt procured me a ſweet oblivion, which yet was diſturbed through the injections of <hi>Morpheus,</hi> for I ſaw a great Cage with this inſcription, <hi>Nec vi, Nec Arte,</hi> an <hi>Emblem</hi> ſurely of my future miſeries, for by and by I ſaw my ſelf faſt encloſed in it, and beſieged with a great company of beaſts, but at laſt, I ſaw a man who came and cut off the head of the chiefe conductor of the brutes, and diſperſing the other, gave me li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                  <p>I know not (proceeded the fair <hi>FLORIA</hi>) whether this was any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural repreſentation from the gods, who often times forewarn us of our future miſeries, by manifeſt ſignes, were not our eyes ſealed with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard, or whether it might be the operation of my affections, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed thoughts, repreſenting thoſe <hi>Ideas</hi> it had preconceiv'd, according to the diſtemper of the natural body; or whether proceeding from the imagination, or the effects of the ſuſcitated vapors and humours, working upon the fancy, but when I awaked I found it left greater impreſſion in my minde than dreames ordinarily do. After I had given ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to my body, though little, through the diſcompoſure of my minde, I hired the ſhepherd to conduct me to <hi>Subelta</hi>'s habitation, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing my ſelf as well as I could, for the better ſecurity of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. After much travel I came to <hi>Condate,</hi> where I underſtood <hi>Subelta</hi> was in my fathers countrey with <hi>Arteſa.</hi> The indiſpoſition of my body, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the aſſaults of my mind, rendred me unfit for travel, therefore,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51633:11"/> diſcharging the ſhepherd, I remained ſometime there, hoping <hi>Subelta</hi>'s return would ſome way terminate theſe diſcompoſures. But ſtay being incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petable with my haſty deſires, I reſolved to encounter him where he was, not conſidering into what preciptation I ran my life and honour, for the one I cared not how ſoon I loſt it, but for the latter I ſhould have had more regard. But having left <hi>Condate</hi> in this precipitancy I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn at my ſecond thoughts, but proceeding in this capricious journey, with a reſolution to evolve my ſelf out of this labrinth of diſquiets, by the fatal ſtroke of death, I have received ſome comfort in that through a ſpecial providence of the gods I have met one to whom with a confidence not uſual I have made known my condition. And now (ſaid ſhe, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſtedfaſtly in my face, with eyes that penetrated to my heart, and whoſe flames had already almoſt conſumed it to aſhes) you have heard without any latitation of my defects, the whole ſcene of this ſad inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude, whoſe laſt act muſt compleat my <hi>Tragedy,</hi> but could you but ſee the integrity of my heart in theſe Caprichio's, with the ſtrong influences that aſcendant Love hath diffuſed on my ſoul, you will not altogether vitupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diſconſolate <hi>Floria</hi> for theſe inconſiderate and capricious actions. Here (went on <hi>Bruadenor</hi>) letting her vaile ſlide down over her face to hide thoſe pearly drops, which the fire of Love, through the declaration and conſideration of her own caſe had diſtilled, it ſeemed to me as the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the earth between <hi>Sol</hi> and bright <hi>Cinthia,</hi> whoſe umbrage caſts ſo dark a vail; or as the Sun darkned through the embraces or intervention of his leſs ſplendid ſiſter.</p>
                  <p>Love exhibiting the beauty of her intellectuals, as well as that of her form, by this time had taken a full and free poſſeſſion of my ſoul, and had gained the chief aſcendancy over my heart, ſo that firſt giving way to ſome ſighs I ſaid. <hi>Madam,</hi> Deſerts are not always favoured by fortune, neither is Love alwayes a pleaſurer of the will, for if the gods croſs our deſires, we ſhould ſhew our patience in bearing their afflictions, and more reſolute are thoſe Lovers who evaporate the heat of their flames by ſighs, and mittigate it with the moiſture of their tears, then thoſe who leſe patient of delayes run themſelves into a thouſand precipitations, for ſelf-murther is not the mark of a valiant perſon, but rather ſhews more cowardize, in that he dares not ſtand out the battel with that which cauſes his deſperation, but to avoid it gives himſelf that which is not juſtifiable but by the hand of another. I cannot blame you in that you Love, or that its vigor hath cauſed you ſomething to tranſgreſs the Pudor of your ſex, though your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be ill cenſured by many tongues. But I cannot without admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and aſtoniſhment conſider the obdurate heart of your deſpiſer, and againſt him fulminate moſt juſt increpations. <hi>Subelta</hi> hath alwayes been my enemy, and hath ſought occaſions to endamage me, but the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of theſe impudicities hath rendred me his, and if this honour may be given to your entertainer, as but to command him into your ſervice, you ſhall ſee how ſoon he ſhall be reduced to a more plyant humour. To this <hi>Floria</hi> returned me an anſwer, full of mildneſs and affection, not induring to hear of <hi>Subelta</hi>'s being reduced by any other means, than by the relapſe of his own will.</p>
                  <p>We were now come to the entrance of my Caſtle, which put a period to our diſcourſe, giving my thoughts liberty to ſtudy complacencies to cauſe her ſtay. I rendred her into the hands of my mother, who knowing by me who ſhe was, cheriſht her in the place of a daughter. The night being come we retired to take our repoſe, but the agitation of my mind baniſht ſleep his wonted reſidence; for entring on a deep contemplation on the luſtre of thoſe beauties, which adorned the face and mind of <hi>Floria.</hi> I ran
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51633:12"/> ſo far into a ſea of thoughts, that I could not reach the Haven of repoſe that night. This was a new world to me, who reſting before in the quietude of my minde, was diſeaſed now with the diſturbances of Love. My mind unequally ballanc't, was toſſed upon the waves of my cogitations, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times entring the liſts for Love, ſometimes oppoſing it as an adverſary, wracked by torments and contrary thoughts I cry out. Ah <hi>Bruadenor!</hi> muſt thou alſo be enumerated amongſt thoſe, who have liſted themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the extravagancies of Love? muſt thy folly be denoted? or is it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable accident to all mortals? is it not better to live free than a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive? and to be a maſter than a ſlave? why then doſt thou debaſe that will, which hitherto hath been free, and make it become a ſlave to beauty? and to a God that delighteth in tyranny, by theſe beginnings of thy diſquiets thou mayeſt judge the effects. Conſider how many this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hath overthrown, recount but the tragedies it hath committed, and thou wilt find innumerable examples of murder and rapine, nay ſhe whom thou adoreſt, is ſo involved in Love with another, that a door of hope is impoſſible to be opened unto thee; unfortunate! take example by others, conſider the precipitancies it hath run her into, and deracinate this folly, before thou haſt too much involved thy ſelf in this common errour.</p>
                  <p>As if theſe words had given power to my will, I thought to have decuſſed this troubleſome paſſion, but whole troops of cogitations, conducted by Love, gave theſe oppoſitions a moſt violent <hi>chocque,</hi> rebating their courage, he diſplayed his banners, ſubjected my reaſon, and led captive my will, and with a voice more beautifull to my eares, inſuſerrated theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Doſt thou think thy ſelf more wiſe than the Ancients, who have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd me for a ſuppreſſor of follies? and call thoſe extravagant who liſt themſelves under my banner? Conſider the innumerable follies attending upon youth, and conſider how regularly I marſhall their exorbitant moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and repleniſh them with many excellent and commendable virtues. Neither count thou my captivity a ſlavery, for though a bondage, yet full of ſweet liberty, and though a priſon, yet full of freedom, where tyranny is not exerciſed but to the content of the lover. If <hi>Mars</hi> have delighted in my thraldome, the muſes have no leſſe honour'd me, by coronizing my head with a crown of flowers, acknowledging the Deity I poſſeſs, the one in that I make the cowardlieſt valiant, and the timorous to atchieve that which without my aſſiſtance he would have fainted to have thought on, the other in that cropping the weeds of vice, I ſow the ſeeds of virtue, and render the heart ſuſceptible to the dictates of knowledge. I have made the ignorant become wiſe, and the learned infuſed with my ſpirit, render themſelves as mortal Deities, and will you call me extravagant, who am the author of all ſcience? Conſider my power and not diſabuſe your ſelf, for you are no more able to redeem your ſelf out of my captivity, than the Gally-ſlave to free himſelf out of his chains.</p>
                  <p>In theſe violent conteſtations I ſpent the time that <hi>Sol</hi> reſided in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hemiſphere,</hi> riſing from my bed wholly captivated with the love of <hi>Floria.</hi> Love now began to ſubtelize my groſſer ſpirits, and infuſe devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fitting for <hi>Amoretta</hi>'s. For knowing the irrecoverable loſſe I ſuffer'd if <hi>Floria</hi> departed, I uſed all the eloquence and Rhetorick Love and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could infuſe, which ſo far prevailed with the loved <hi>Floria,</hi> that ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to ſtay, and to let me ſend one into her fathers countrey to learn their deportments at her loſſe, as alſo to know the certainty of <hi>Subelta</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there.</p>
                  <p>A day or two paſſed, wherein I contemplated the beauty ſo deſpiſed by

I ſeemed not to live but in her ſight, and I joyed in no other company than hers, but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually died when I conſidered my miſerable eſtate, and though the motions of my eyes might have diſcovered the ſecrets of my heart, yet in her I perceived not the leaſt regard. Oh the pains! oh the anguiſh my ſoul felt, when I thought of diſcovering my mind to her, fearing a killing repulſe, and dreading the thunder of her anger, for a true Lover continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lives in fear. But ſeeing ſhe read not my mind by my countenance, nor my eyes the true meſſengers of the heart, I reſolved, having a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity in being alone with her in a boury to explaine my ſelf, but as often as I was about to begin, fear repulſed my determination, but at laſt with a faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring tongue I emitted theſe words.</p>

I immediately departed, and to be the leſs taken notice of, took no company but my Squire, and ſo went ſtraight to the <hi>Santons</hi> Countrey.</p>
                  <p>I travelled without any diſturbance, till being almoſt at my jorneyes end very early in the morning I met three men diſguiſed with a woman behind one of them, whom I judg'd by her tears and lamentations to beforceably born away by thoſe villanies. Though the number were unequal, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I ſhould incur to oppoſe them, were enough to deter me, yet invited by the lacrymations of the weaker ſex, eſpecially when eſpying me, ſhe implored my aſſiſtance, I could do no leſs than reſolve to aid her, though it were to the hazard of my life. Riding up to them I ſought with gentle ſpeeches to convince them of an error in which they were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to perſiſt. <hi>Bruadenor</hi> (ſaith one of theſe diſguiſhed ones who had the deplorable creature behind him) thou hadſt more need uſe thy tongue, to ſave thy ſelf, than perſwade us to leave this prize, thou art the only man I deſir'd to meet, to render this friend into thy boſome (drawing out his Rapier) that thou mayeſt acknowledge thy error, when it is too late to repent, the gods propitious to my deſignes, have put thee into my hands, from which thou ſhalt not ſo ſoon eſcape. Whilſt he uttered thoſe words with a diſagreeing tone I had time to draw my weapon, and his fellow-Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, to disburden his horſe of the Subject of our ſtrife. We reiterated our blows with forceable verberations, and with many endeavours wounded one another, at laſt fortune ſending a gentle <hi>aura</hi> upon my devoirs, with a vigorous thruſt which ſtruck into his ſhoulder bone, I turned him over the crooper of his horſe. Whilſt his body was precipitating to the earth, one of the other whoſe ſoul poſſeſt not the leaſt ſpark of generoſity, with a cowardly blow made me feel the like fortune as my oppoſer. Enraged at this vile uſage, receiving no wound through the goodneſs of my armour under
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51633:13"/> an upper coat, I ſoon recovered my leggs, and with a thruſt paſſed the other off his horſe, who had got the damſel behind him, and before any of them could aſſail me, with a leap I aſcended the horſe before her, making him ſhow the nimbleneſs of his heels to my oppoſers. He that had not loſt his horſe purſued me with the like velocity, till we had loſt the ſight of the other two. Not induring to fly before one, I let the damſel reſide the horſe, and met my adverſary in his carrere, where with many thruſts we ſought to end the quarrel by unmortallizing one another. Whilſt we purſued our advantages, the laſt man I had made to kiſs the earth reincountred me, both uſing the utmoſt of their skill to kill me, but their fury carrying them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the guide of reaſon, made them diſreguard all the rules of Art, and gave me many advantages to annoy them. In the mean time he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the firſt fall, though wounded, had recovered his horſe, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took us, but leaving the other two to decide the quarrel, he ſeaſed upon the damſel who ſtood quaking to ſee the event. Her ſcreeks gave me notice of her Raviſher, and turning my head aſide, I ſaw, notwithſtanding the ſtrugling that affrighted one maid, he had laid her before him upon his horſe, and to be aſſured of his prey, he made a forward fugacity. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that poſſeſt me to reſcue the damſel out of that fugitive's tallents, gave me a vigor not ordinary, ſo that paſſing and repaſſing my ſword through one of my adverſaries, I laid him on the earth to breath his laſt, and the other fainting ſunk from his horſe. I made no ſtay, but purſued the abacted damſel, quickly overtaking the Raviſher, being hindred much by her ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and the tardineſs of his horſe onerated with a double burden. <q rend="margQuotes">"Stay baſe villane (ſaid I) thou art not ſo ſoon eſcaped the hands of Juſtice, nor ſhall thy ſlight be able to hinder the juſt vengeance the heavens will inflict upon thee, by my arm, for the wrong done to this damſel.</q> I gave him no liberty to reply, but adding more wounds to his former, I reduc'd him to ſupply the defect of his vigor with his tears, and with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the injury done to the damſel to beg his life at my hands.

I repli'd, The ſervice I undertook, my honour and compaſſion obliged me to, and that I look'd for no other guerdion for my pains than the knowledge how ſhe came into the hands of thoſe Raviſhers.

I have ſeen the effects of your ſtrength, I am freed by your valour, and have taſted the goodneſs of your vertue, which extending to help the diſtreſſed is an act worthy of perpetual fame. But not to fill your ears with my applauſe, I will give you the account you deſired.</p>

                  <p> My name is <hi>Arteſa,</hi> I was born in this Countrey, and am daughter to a Lord of a Caſtle not far diſtant, our uſual abode is at a pleaſant place, from whence this night I was raviſhed, and where by a loſs I doubt I am made perpetually miſerable, but when I am aſſured on't, my dayes ſhall termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with its knowledge. Tears (ſaid <hi>Bruadenor</hi>) guſhing from two lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid fountains, at the remembrance of ſome paſt evenements, ſtopped the paſſage of her words, till two or three forceable ſuſpirations had reclear'd the way: then proceeding. I have been (ſaid ſhe) ſo unhappy as to be lov'd by that unworthy one whom your valour laſt overcame, whoſe name is <hi>Subelta</hi> Lord of the <hi>Redons,</hi> if Love can be ſaid to harbour in ſo Tyrannick a breaſt, or in one who hath dealt ſo cruelly not only by me that hateth him, but by a Lady who hath intirely lov'd him, as by his own relation I underſtood. This <hi>Subelta</hi> being entertained at the Caſtle of the Chief Lord of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> his daughter, the fair <hi>Floria</hi> (ſo they call'd her at <hi>Rome,</hi> which name ſhe hath ſince kept) fell in love with him. Unworthy wretch diſpiſing her Amoretta's and careſſes he put her into an affliction, which produced a ſickneſs that almoſt coſt her her life. He hath often recounted to me the joy he ſhould conceive at her death, that he might be rid of an importunate Suter, and hath recited her endeavours, her careſſes, and ſhowen me her letters, which though full of paſſion, yet alſo implete with modeſty. I have wondred when I ſaw ſo evidently her paſſion for him, that he ſhould deſpiſe her and accoſt me, who am far inferior in birth and beauty, and I ever councell'd him not to let her languiſh in deſpair, and forſake the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for the ſhadow, uſing all the perſwaſive arguments my weak Genius was capable of. But as it is natural for us to deſpiſe what's profer'd, and crave what we cannot obtain, ſo he left a beauty that accoſted him, and ſought to acquire me who deſpis'd him. For having before given my heart to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (though a ſtranger, yet one whom I accounted worthy of my love) his allurements could not incite me to relinquiſh him, nor the illectament of preferment, to be perfideous to my pretendant. When I perceiv'd, if his ſuit continued, it might put me to much trouble, and if he intended what he ſaid, he might, gaining my father, force me to marry him. I treated him after a vigorous and rough manner, which did but ſuſcitate his ardour of obtaining. I cannot but think (went ſhe on) but that his paſſion was real, and impoſ'd upon him by the juſt deityes for his cruel diſdain to <hi>Floria,</hi> for having recovered her ſickneſs very lately, as ſhe was travelling through a large wood, ſhe was ſtrangely convey'd away with her maid unknown to any of her company, which news ſo afflicted her father, that he ſcarce could recover ſtrength to live. At his command the wood was throughly ſearcht, and in their perquiſition, they found ſome part of the body of <hi>Floria</hi>'s maid, and clothes which had been the reliques of the feaſt of ſome fierce animal. Thinking <hi>Floria</hi> her ſelf had run the like fortune, they returned with part of a cacraſe miſerably laniated, which ſpectacle with the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his daughters loſs, had almoſt ſuffocated his vitals, and as yet he remains in a languid condition, in conſideration of her detriment. All that knew her, or had but heard of her beauty or vertues, could not but reſent her diſaſter, and plunge themſelves into the waves of a juſt ſorrow, this wretch excepted, who told me her miſfortune with the Symptomes of Joy. This cauſ'd me more than ever to hate him, ſeeing his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity, and to ſhew him a more ſeverer brow.</p>
                  <p>His haughty diſpoſition not able to bear my deportments, He addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to my father, gaining him to make me his wife, if I would conſent: Aſſoon as I underſtood by my father how <hi>Subelta</hi> had delt with him to have me, and that he began to perſwade me, I had no other way but with my tears to ſupplicate my mother (who had a great aſcendencie over
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51633:14"/> my father) to fruſtrate the deſign of <hi>Subelta,</hi> and not to force me by that marriage to end my dayes miſerable. My mother following my intereſts, obtain'd this boon at the hands of my father. The next time he importun'd my father concerning it, he told him if he could gain my good will, his deſires accorded with his requeſt, but his indulgence had made him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, not to force me to any marriage. <hi>Subelta</hi> thought himſelf highly affronted to be denied in that manner, yet hiding it what he could, he ſought to acquire me by the great proteſtations of his affections. But at laſt his ſight being as odious to me, as his company was troubleſome, I let him know in very ſharp terms how much I hated him, bidding him never ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine or think of obtaining me, for he ſhould ſooner bring the heavons and earth together than obtain my love, commanding him to avoid my ſight.

In this choler he left our houſe, threatning what he would do, but the joy for his departure took away the regard of his threats. My Parents conſidering what an irritated ſpirit might attempt, were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing troubled at his deportments, and blamed me for my temerity. I ſent for him whoſe fidelity had attracted my heart, to make him acquainted with <hi>Subelta</hi>'s deportments, and to enjoy thoſe careſſes which the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Subelta</hi> had impedited.

                  <p>We paſſed the time in thoſe ſweet careſſes and pleaſances that are enjoyed by Lovers, and are delightfull to thoſe that are entred Loves pleaſing bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and ſervitude. When the night began to wear out her ſables, we parted, appointing the time of our next meeting, which I believe was heard by <hi>Subetla,</hi> who I ſuppoſe might be hid in the grove, and heard our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, for that when he carried me away, he uttered ſome words which I ſpake concerning him that night. My thoughts are grounded on this, becauſe this night which is paſt, being the time I appointed my Confident to meet me, we had no ſooner ſeated our ſelves in the grove, but that <hi>Subelta,</hi> and the other two diſguiſed entred upon us. I knew <hi>Subelta</hi> by his voice, who gave no time for <hi>Phineriaz,</hi> (ſo is he termed) to draw his weapon, but with his ready drawn, thruſt it through his body. Seeing him fall with a crimſon ſtream ſlowing from his wound, I gave a ſudden ſcreek, and ſwounded in <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belta</hi>'s arms. In that condition they abrepted me, half an hour expiring e're I came to my ſelf again, but when I ſaw my ſelf in his power whom I hated, carried away from him whom I loved, I am not able to repreſent the dolor of my ſoul, but at laſt breaking the bonds of my ſilence, <q rend="margQuotes">"Wicked <hi>Subelta!</hi> cruel <hi>Subelta!</hi> (ſaid I) is this the effect of your paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? is this the end of your oaths? is this the termination of your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? is this love that uſeth violence?

They could not underſtand by him how he came ſo wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor how he came there at that time of the night. But I explained the doubt to <hi>Arteſa</hi>'s father, repreſenting the great love that was betwixt them, and ſo far prevailed with him, that he conſented to their marriage. This <hi>Arteſa</hi> took as the higheſt piece of ſervice could be rendred her, and with innumerable thanks ſought to expreſs it. <hi>Phineriaz</hi> conceived no leſs joy at the knowledge of it, which feſtinated his recovery, and when I left them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing was prepared for their <hi>Hymen.</hi> Aſſoon as my wounds were healed, I urg'd my departure, telling them the importunity of my buſineſs would admit me no delay. They ſought on the other ſide with all the words of invitation could poſſibly be rendred to keep me there: And truly their affability and extaordinary Curteſie had gain'd ſo great aſcendancy over me, that it had detained me longer, had not the ſpur of love pricked me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for my thoughts were on <hi>Floria,</hi> my care was for <hi>Floria,</hi> my fears were for <hi>Floria,</hi> and all my imaginations were taken up in the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Floria,</hi> ſo that it was impoſſible for me to ſtay without incurring ſome inconvenience by my paſſion. This broke all bands, and made me force my way through their courteſies, for I knew not but <hi>Floria</hi> hearing of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belta</hi>'s return might go to effect her reſolved purpoſe, which thought made me leave <hi>Arteſa</hi> and the reſt, loaded with their Courtiſes.</p>
                  <p>Love lent me wings to fly, and accelerated my jorney, whilſt deſire ſent many precurſary thoughts to viſit <hi>Floria,</hi> and at laſt I arrived where long before my imganition had carried me. I ſoon gave an account to my God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of all my paſt evenements, which I perceiv'd ſhe heard with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, although ſhe could not but reſent the Joy <hi>Subelta</hi> conceiv'd at her death, and thereby ſhe perceiv'd that the unmortalizing her ſelf before him would work no remorſe in his conſcience. I ſaw the excited paſſion in her breaſt, and conceiving whence it was ſuſcitated, I aggravated their circumſtances, knowing it made well for my intereſts, and the effect anſwered my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for it ſhook the foundations of her Love to <hi>Subelta,</hi> and rendred me more acceptable in her ſight.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Subelta</hi> enraged at the death of one of his companions, who was a kinſman of his, and at his evil fortune, having recovered thoſe wounds which he received at my hands: he raiſed a band of men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to invade ſome places under my juriſdiction. I ſoon heard of his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, and for my ſecurity began to raiſe ſome men for my defence, but he ſo vigorouſly proceeded, that he had taken many places ere I could come to oppoſe him, and arrogantly in the hearing of moſt of his followers, had vowed my utter deſtruction: at laſt with thoſe whom I had haſtily gathered together I gave him battle, and by the disfavour of fortune loſt moſt of my men with the victory. This loſs hightned the arrogancy of my enemy, who following his good ſucceſs, won almoſt all the places of ſtrength from me, and followed me ſo cloſe, that I could hardly remuſter the diſperſed,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51633:15"/> and fill up the bands with more men, but at laſt I had gained a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able body, and was reſolved once more to try the hazard of a battel. <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> hearing what paſſed, though ſhe had attenuated her paſſion for <hi>Subelta,</hi> ſent him a very kind Letter, deſiring him to deſiſt, and not to proſecute me ſo vigorouſly when I had ſav'd his life. <hi>Subelta</hi> ſent her an anſwer by the ſame meſſenger (which ſhe ſhewed me) wherein he told her, that the joy he had conceiv'd at his thinking her dead was converted into ſorrow at the knowledge of her being alive, and that becauſe ſhe had mentioned, ſhe deſired no longer to live, he would become her executioner to rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of ſuch a plague, &amp; that becauſe ſhe had deſired him to deſiſt from injuring me, he would double his fury to annoy me &amp; utterly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed (ſaid <hi>Bruadenor</hi>) at the impudency of this man, &amp; it ſuſcitated an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary paſſion of revenge in my breaſt, hearing the vile ſpeeches his Letter was farced with. But I may bleſs that Letter, ſeeing it was the cauſe that <hi>Floria</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew her love from him, for it excited a generous indignation in her gentle breaſt, and at length caus'd her to ſee the unworthineſſe of the object ſhe had loved, and to conſider me in her thoughts. <q rend="margQuotes">"Why have I loved <hi>Subelta</hi> (ſayes <hi>Floria</hi>) with ſo much fervency, ſeeing he deſpiſes me? why have I loved him with ſo much verity, ſeeing he deſpiſes me? well I will diſregard him, and ſhake off that love which hath caus'd me ſo much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing the gods have given me power to do it.</q> And let me adde (ſaid I) <hi>and regard him who loves with ſo much paſſion.</hi> The ſmile which ſhe ſweetly made ſhewed ſhe was nothing diſpleaſed at my words, which gave me great content, and in my heart I pardoned <hi>Subelta</hi> all the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I had conceiv'd againſt him, ſeeing this opprobrity had been the cauſe of my felicity.</p>
                  <p>The time that I remained in the Caſtle with her I improved to my beſt advantage, and before I returned to the camp, ſhe aſſured me ſhe had no more thoughts for <hi>Subelta,</hi> biding me to uſe my beſt endeavours to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my enemie, and to free my ſelf from trouble, and if it lay in her power to pleaſure me, I ſhould not fear her performance. This tranſported me beyond my ſelf, and you may be ſure I rendred her thouſands of thanks for her benignitie, and aſſurances of my Loyalty, which induced her to tell me I held the place of <hi>Subelta,</hi> and that my troubles ended ſhe would accompliſh my deſires. The vigor wherewith theſe ſpeeches im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued my ſoul, carried me with an ardent deſire of fighting to the Camp, where convocating my troops I animated them with my ſpeeches, begetting as great a deſire of fighting in them, as I retained in my ſelf, ſo that not ſtaying for ſome auxiliaries we raſhly encountred our enemies, whoſe number far exceeded ours. My example made many cowards valiant, and animated thoſe who had any ſpark of courage in their ſouls; for Love imbuing me with a kinde of military Phrenſie, I ſo much paſſed my common vigor, that I wondred at my own actions, and ſtood amazed at my own force, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place where I went I laid rampiars of dead carcaſes about me, I often called <hi>Subelta</hi> by name, but could never find him, for I believe he ſhun'd incountring me at that time.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51633:16"/> were all diſperſed. Seeing my ſelf brought to this calamitie, deſpaire and ſhame had almoſt made me to deſtroy that life, which the force of all my enemies could not take away. Having loſt the victory, I could not have the confidence to inviſage <hi>Floria,</hi> which made me I would not put my ſelf into the Caſtle, but ſent thoſe few which remained to ſecure it from the attempts of <hi>Subelta,</hi> knowing its ſtrength to be ſuch, that if their proviſion laſted, all the power of <hi>Subelta</hi> could never atchieve it. I ſent a Letter to my mother, and to the chief of thoſe who were in the Caſtle, how they ſhould hold it to the very uttermoſt againſt <hi>Subelta's</hi> force, whilſt I went to get aid for their releaſment. <hi>Subelta</hi> was forced to ſend for men, his loſs was ſo conſiderable in our laſt depraeliation, before he could beſiege the Caſtle, ſo that they fortified it with men, and pretty well ſtored it with proviſion before he came to beſiege them. In the mean time I ſought the <hi>Romans</hi> to help me againſt my adverſary, who giving me good words, filled me with vain hopes, and made me ſpend my time when they intended nothing leſſe. One who was conſiderable amongſt them taking pitie on me told me that it would be a folly to attend their ſuccours, for that they did not intend in verity to help me, adviſing me if in any other place I thought I could have help, I ſhould not loſe my time in ſeeking help of them. Perceiving the integrity of the man, I followed his councel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretting their proceedings, I left them, being neceſſitated to take ſhiping, and repair to <hi>Africa,</hi> where I had an uncle who had great command under the <hi>Romans,</hi> he with great ſpeed manned four good ſhips, both with <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Barbarians:</hi> giving me the conduct, I once more went to try the favour of fortune. We were no ſooner engaged in the Ocean, but that impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſtorm (which caſt you on the <hi>Deſolate Iſland</hi>) ſever'd us, and as if Fortune had ſwore my overthrow, with imminent danger hurried us along this vaſt ſea. What is become of the other ſhips I know not, but the ſtorme paſſed, we endeavoured to proceed, when meeting with the Pyrat I had the honour to free you, and to engage you on my behalf.</p>
                  <p>Having heard this narration from the <hi>Gaul</hi> (went on <hi>Euripedes</hi>) I aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him my devoirs ſhould be to do him ſervice, and to reſettle him in his former ſtate. He ſeemed very joyful of my company, and told me his hopes were increaſed ſince I had undertook to help him, and that the gods had pre-ordain'd me to be the inſtrument of all his happineſs. Greatly contented with this <hi>Gauls</hi> company, I paſſed my time upon the waters, and our ſhip without any oppoſition glided over thoſe deeps. At laſt we paſſed by the mouth of the river <hi>Ligeris,</hi> and put in upon the coaſts of the <hi>Veneti,</hi> whereof <hi>Bruadenor</hi> was Lord. Here we found the ſhips he had ſpoken of arrived two or three days before us, and were in great perplexity for <hi>Bruadenor,</hi> ſeeing after ſo impetuous a ſtorm they had ſo happily met, they raiſed a hope for their future fortunes, and with great alacrity began their enterprize.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Bruadenor</hi> muſtred his men, and gave order for his intendments, I ſought a nurſe for the infant Fortune had caſt into my hands, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>id of that nurſery, I might the better imploy my endeavours to his help. I ſoon found a woman whoſe child was newly interr'd, with whom I left the child and money for her pains, I reſerved a little bracelet which ſurrounded the childs neck, in which was a remarkable ſtone, hoping by that (if fortune caſt me into their company) to find out the parents of the child, I gave the woman charge to call the child <hi>Marinus,</hi> which ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do, and to take him into the place of her own. <hi>Bruadenor</hi> having underſtood by his ſcouts that the next day <hi>Subelta</hi> reſolved to give an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault to the Caſtle, not as yet underſtanding of his arrival, he deſired not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51633:16"/> to loſe that opportunity of aſſailing him in the midſt of his diſpute. For this end we marched all night in by-places, through the help of certaine guides, ſo ſecretly that it was not known to <hi>Subelta,</hi> for thoſe we met we took along with us, that they might not diſcover us. By day break we came within the ſight of the Caſtle and of our enemies, the morning we ſpent in ſleep to reſt our wearied limbs to be the better able to perform our Devoirs, being hid from the ſight of our enemies by the umbrage of a Wood.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as <hi>Subelta</hi> had begun the aſſault with much vigor, we attended till they had ſpent their chief ſtrength againſt the walls, and the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, letting them perſiſt till they had throughly wearied themſelves; we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſpectators. But ſeeing a gate in danger to be loſt by the continual preſſure of <hi>Subelta,</hi> who was ſignaliz'd from the reſt, we gave a ſigne to our Troops, and all together like an impetuous ſtream came ruſhing upon the backs of theſe aſſailants. You may imagine whether our unexpected co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming did not amaze our enemies, and give no leſs courage to the beſieged, ſeeing ſuccour arrived when they leaſt expected it. The greatneſs of our ſlaughter augmented their amatement, and by a ſudden viciſſitude made them relinquiſh being aſſailants, and become defendants. Victory was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeated on our ſide, and we fought with the greater animoſity ſeeing her on our ſide. <hi>Bruadenor</hi> performed wonders ſeeing the battlements of the Caſtle graced with his <hi>Floria,</hi> who with the reſt of her ſex were mounted the Taraſſes to behold the performances of this help. Fear began to ſcare <hi>Subelta</hi>'s ſoul, and he manifeſted his fear by his retreat, for being preſſed on all ſides they made uſe of their legs to ſave their lives. But thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Caſtle iſſuing out, we made a general ſlaughter, <hi>Bruadenor</hi> ſeeking for <hi>Subelta,</hi> with his own hands ended his Tragedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Floria</hi> having exterminated <hi>Subelta</hi> the confines her heart, found no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine motions at the ſight of his death, but giving a good reception to his conqueror, manifeſted the content ſhe receiv'd by her liberty. They ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured me by taking notice of the ſmall ſervice I had done them, and were careful to dreſſe ſome wounds which I had receiv'd in the conflict. After their mutual congratulations <hi>Bruadenor</hi> return'd to give order for to ſepu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the dead, and to feſtinate ſome troops who were going to reduce thoſe places which <hi>Subelta</hi> had taken, which in ſhort time they effected, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his <hi>Signiory</hi> to his priſtine ſtate. Having enjoyed ſome time the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of <hi>Floria,</hi> I conſider'd <hi>Bruadenor</hi> had not reported amiſs of her beauty, nor was the beauty of her wit leſs graceful than that of her face. I who till then had conſider'd women with a conſtant eye, never ſaw at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions in any face which had power to raiſe commotions in my heart, (and whilſt I enjoy'd that happy liberty, I breathed in the aire of felicity, but after Love had rendred my heart ſuſceptable of his impreſſions, I found my ſelf bound with the chains of captivity) now perceived by ſome inſtinct in nature they were made deſirable to men. I had conſidered them as ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, not ſo much as deſiring, (but rather ſhunning) their converſation, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring at thoſe men, who bewitched with their attractions, gave them the encomiums of Deities. The converſation of <hi>Floria</hi> aboliſht thoſe thoughts, not that I had any deſire or thoughts for her more than any other, but that as praelibations they rendred my heart ſuſceptible for greater flames, and took off the precogitated opinion of the indignity of their ſex. That little tyrant of hearts was now reſolved to plague me for my contumacy, and as I had accounted them as ſhadows, to make me love the ſhadows of them, and becauſe I had diſregarded beauty, beauty ſhould cauſe my diſregard. For one day in viewing the ſeveral rooms in the Caſtle which till then I had not ſeen, I beheld the effigies of a Lady which hung for an ornament

In my heart (I muſt confeſſe) I call'd my ſelf fool, for thoſe emotions which I felt producted by thoſe lovely and lively looks, becauſe it was but a ſhadow, and it may be delineated from the phancy of ſome painter, to ſhew the rarity of his Graphical art. I had loſt my ſelf in the contemplation of it, had not <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I highly prais'd the piece according as it deſerv'd; And taking hold on that opportunity, I told them I took great delight in good pictures, which made me take the boldneſſe as to entreat them to let it adorn my chamber whilſt I was with them. My intreaties and their grants were all one, ſo that it was immediately tranſported to my chamber. I forgot not to ask them whether it was the portraiture of any living and of whom. <hi>Brua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denor</hi> told me he had bought it of a famous <hi>Apellean,</hi> and that it was the true and lively effigies of <hi>Amenia,</hi> daughter to <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> the chief Ruler over the <hi>Auſtures:</hi> adding that her beauty had tempted many <hi>Romans,</hi> but her hatred to that nation would not let her condeſcend to marry any of them, ſo that as yet ſhe remained in her Virgin ſtate. This added fuel to my fire, and ſuſcitated more ardent flames for the inviſaging this princeſſe. Finding a pleaſant titillation in theſe thoughts, I began to have a more plauſible opinion of the <hi>Amorous Deity,</hi> and giving ſcope to my thoughts, I permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to wander into the <hi>Wantons</hi> labyrinth.</p>
                  <p>At the firſt exhibition of an opportunity I relinquiſht the company of <hi>Brua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Having included my ſelf in my chamber, I ſet that bewitching effigies before me, and with profound conſiderations beheld all its lineaments. Breaking out in the midſt of my ſilent cogitations, <q rend="margQuotes">"Ah beauty! (ſaid I) is it poſſible to reſiſt thy attraction? or to ſhut our eyes againſt ſo fair an object? Can thy venuſt exhibitions be ſeen by any, without paſſion for thy poſſeſſion? I have been too grand an enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your Soveraignty; but to expiate that crime I will become as much a ſlave to your greatneſs. A deſirable object! who cannot but adore thoſe lily-intermixed Roſes, which expand themſelves on thy cheeks? and conſider the motion of thoſe bright twinklers in the Aſtrolabe of a ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind? which caſts as great an influence on the heart of a lover as the coeleſtial bodies do on terrene ſubſtances. Many ſuch ejections were</q> emitted, whilſt my thoughts were extended on the object, and whilſt my conſiderations laſted, that Amorous fire burnt my ſoul, and deeply inſculpt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the character of <hi>Amenia</hi> on my heart. Thus whilſt love conquered, my liberty was orewhelm'd, and I ran into the foulneſſe of love, through the fairneſs of a picture, and ſo far introducted through the conſiderations of that effigies, that it was impoſſible for me to return into the ſtate I was in, before I ſaw it. I loſt many houres, and I ſpent much time in viewing and reviewing that delectable object, and I ſpent much time in viewing and

It ſhames me ſince to remember my follies, and it would ſhame me more to relate them, had I not undertaken to ſhew my extravagancies that you may ſee the folly of theſe inſuls <hi>Amoretta</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>But to abbreviate the relations of theſe follies, I ſhall only tell you that my ſoul was ſo imbrued with that fooliſhly fooliſh Love as I was reſolved to depart into <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſee the ſubſtance, of what I had ſeen in ſhadow, for having ſo much lik't the ſhadow, I ſhould much more like the ſubſtance, but moſt of all, could the love of that ſubſtance be acquired.

Whilſt we remained in <hi>Vindana</hi> preparing for <hi>Bruadenor</hi> and <hi>Floria's Himenean</hi> triumph, ſome men whom I had ſent to fetch <hi>Araterus</hi> from the <hi>Deſolate</hi> Iſland returned, but with no news of him. At firſt I was ſenſible of his loſſe, but Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like the ſoporiferous <hi>Opium,</hi> cauſed ſo great Lethefaction, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained nothing in my memory, but the infarſings of Love. As <hi>Opium</hi> cauſeth ſtupifaction by the abundance of ſulphureous ſpirits which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, ſo that agitating fire of Love, cauſeth oblivion through the intenſe operation of the faculties of the ſoul. I might compare my ſelf then to a full veſſel, which could not receive any thing becauſe of its plenitude, for having imbibed the delicious draughts of the <hi>Dionean</hi> youth, it ſo fill'd my ſoul that I was not capable to receive any thing elſe; ſo that I could not conceive much ſorrow for the loſſe of <hi>Araterus</hi> at that time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vindana</hi> was now full of many people who were congregated, ſome to behold, and others to help at the nuptials, and the day being come, a great deal of pomp was ſhewn, which was not uſual with thoſe (whom the <hi>Romans</hi> call <hi>Barbarians</hi>) before their converſation amongſt them. After the Ceremonies uſed according to the faſhion of the <hi>Romans</hi> (to whom

                     <hi>Bruadenor</hi> was a great friend) many being preſent, and aſſiſtants at the Spouſals, made the ſtreets eccho <hi>Tallaſſius.</hi> After a very ſumptuous feaſt, wherein <hi>Bruad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>When man hath loſt the freedome of his Will, by the captivity of love, how different are his actions from thoſe, before his ſoul was imbued with that ſelf-diſtracting fancy? Being in freedome, he hath the liberty to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things without paſſion to ſee another look on the ſame beauty with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without envy, and thought of rival-ſhip, to deport himſelf with great correſpondency to all, to have conſideration in his atchievements, and Reaſon accompanying all his actions. But the ſeene being altered by Love, his precipitating affection ſuſcitates ſuch paſſion, that he is not able to conſider things as they are, nor ſee another view that object in which Love intereſts him without envy, paſſion, and trouble; making him deport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with great incongruity to others, and to fling himſelf inconſiderately into dangerous precipies, baniſhing Reaſon from all his actions. In the one ſtate he is a Prince, in the other a ſlave, in the one he rules his affections, and maſters his paſſions, in the other his affections guides him, and his paſſion ſubdues him, being carried down the violent ſtream of his deſires full of blindneſs. I ſpeak this (went he on) becauſe I had (before my love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>follies) judged thoſe whoſe <hi>Amours</hi> had carried them into the like extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances, and now I judge my ſelf to be moſt egregiouſly fooliſh in many unadviſed actions. But this hap'ned (which I am about to tell you) which manifeſted my folly. A little before night there came into the place where theſe ſhews were exhibited, a <hi>Roman</hi> Captain, who had cauſ'd <hi>Amenia</hi>'s picture to be painted on his Buckler. Aſſoon as I had caſt my eye upon it, I knew the portraiture, by the reſemblance it had to that which I had ſeen in <hi>Bruadenors</hi> Caſtle. Love fill'd me with jealouſies, and jealouſies with envy, ſo that I found a great combuſtion within me at the ſight of this ſimulacre. I immediately took him for my Rival, and that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tting, but conſidered not the danger of atchieving: But Love that animates the heart to any bold action, made me reſolve to attacque him, and how dear ſo ever it coſt me to obtain it. Whilſt I entertain'd many projects for the obtaining of my deſire, I perceiv'd him to leave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and to ride away, marking the way he rode, I abruptly left <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adenor,</hi> and taking one of his Courſers followed him with ſpeed. Aſſoon as I had overtaken him, I asked him whether that beauty was expoſed to ſale, ſeeing he ſo openly exhibited it to vulgar eyes. This <hi>Quirinan</hi> ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered, that the purchaſe was the laſt drop of blood that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the deſirer. I replyed that ſo exquiſite a beauty deſerv'd no leſs, however I told him, if he would give it me as a gift, I would gratifie him with all the power I was able, if not, I was reſolved to expoſe my life for the obtaining of it, and that I had purpoſely followed him for that end. I am not (re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51633:18"/> turned to blows, his in the juſt defence of his own; mine in the unjuſt proſecuting my deſires, I ſought by offending illegally to take away his right, he ſought by defending legally to keep his own; he ſhewed valour by defending, I cowardize by attempting. It ſhamed me to think that I, who ſhould (following the precepts of vertue) have ſpent the utmoſt of my vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor in maintaining Legality, ſhould (following the dictates of vice) ſpend the utmoſt of my ſtrength in performing an illegal action. This conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſomewhat rebated the edge of my fury, with his expoſing that <hi>effigies</hi> againſt the edge of my ſword, which like a <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s head ſtifned my arm; ſo that I had not power to hurt my adverſary for fear of impairing, or hurting that Image; ſuch abſurd ceremonies had that infatuating Love impoſ'd upon me, as to obſerve ſo much reverence to a ſhadow, to the imminent danger of my life.</p>
                  <p>We were but in the <hi>praeludium</hi> of our combate, when there arrived a <hi>Gaul,</hi> whole valor againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> was well known. This <hi>Gaul</hi> had received ſome diſgrace by me in the exerciſes that day, which it ſeems had ſtir'd up a revenge, and for that cauſe he had watcht my actions for an opportunity of effecting it. He took notice of my departure, and therefore followed me, but finding me already engag'd, he harbored not ſo much of the Coward, as to help my adverſary, nor yet could his eager revenge be content another ſhould puniſh me. Coming near us he drew his ſword, and directing his ſpeech to my adverſary, Remit this combate (ſaid he) and be a Spectator a while, and you ſhall ſee your enemy puniſht without your pains, for your pretenſions nor deſires can be ſo great as mine to fight this oppoſer. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever your pretentions or deſires are (reply'd the <hi>Roman</hi>) I think my ſelf able to afflict a puniſhment on him as your ſelf, nor will I be ſo much a Coward to leave a combate begun, and ſee another finiſh it, if I have the fortune to ſlay him, you may be ſatisfied, if he kills me you may then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter him. The <hi>Gauls</hi> hatred to the <hi>Romans</hi> was the cauſe he was ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary moved, for very furiouſly both with words and blows he reply'd, Seeing with a fair remittance you will not give me leave to fight another, being both enemies a like to me, I will attacque you both. The thunder of his blows took away the ſound of the reſt of his words, and engag'd us both to a diſcreet defence againſt ſo ſudden an aſſault, for ſometimes he ſpent his vigor on the <hi>Roman,</hi> and ſometimes I ſuſtained the fury of his ſtrooks. I unwilling to give over my firſt combatant, ſometimes gave him many reiterated ſtrooks, and ſometimes to oppoſe the <hi>Gauls</hi> furie, I was fain to deal my blows upon him. The <hi>Roman</hi> ſometimes oppoſed the <hi>Gaul,</hi> and ſometimes requited me with the like I gave. In this confuſed ſtrife each had two adverſaries, and peril attended our promiſcuous encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the rules of art could not be diſplayed in that confuſion. We had all of us receiv'd ſome wounds, and were very hot in receiving and giving of more, when <hi>Bruadenor</hi> ariv'd with three or four Gentlemen with him, who having miſſed me, and by enquiry underſtood of my departure, imagined ſome duel, and being very carefull of my well-fare, he came himſelf to ſeek me: As he arrived, I had diſmounted the <hi>Roman,</hi> and ſeizing on his buckler, I rent it from his arm: having the poſſeſſion of it, I affreſh op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the <hi>Gaul,</hi> but <hi>Bruadenor</hi>'s arrival put a period to our treble encounter. The nights ſable mantles beginning to diſplay themſelves, cauſ'd us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and leave my Contenders there, having firſt underſtood of the <hi>Gaul</hi> wherein I had offended him; I ſhew'd <hi>Bruadenor</hi> the cauſe and manner of our ſight, yet ſo that he underſtood not the great affection I bore to <hi>Amenia,</hi> or of my folly in getting the ſhield.</p>
                  <p>My noble entertainer as ſoon as we were returned had regard to my wounds which were inconſiderable, and could not detian me from exerciſing my ſelf in thoſe masks which were performed that night, and which deter'd <hi>Brua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denor</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:51633:19"/> thoſe wiſhed pleaſures till almoſt morning, but the better part of the next day made him amends for the nights injury. Theſe nuptial joyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed, and <hi>Bruadenor</hi> about to return to his Caſtle with his <hi>Floria,</hi> I renewed my ſuit for my departure, deſiring him not to deter me any longer with his intreaties. The regret he ſhewed for my departure manifeſted the love he bore me, but ſeeing it was impoſſible to keep me any longer, he was conſtrained to ſubmit to this ſeveration. He ſupply'd my want of a Horſe with one of the beſt he had: and for my better defence made me clothe my ſelf with ſome of his ſureſt harneſs. I had a thouſand <hi>Eulogies</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon me by this kind friend and his fair bride, who diſtil'd ſome pearly tears at my departure. After I had left them, I directed my courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Spain; Amenia</hi>'s beauty having the Magnetick vertue of attraction, for ſhe was the Pole-ſtar to which I turn'd. It was now the midſt of Summer, and <hi>Titans Aethon</hi> gave his greateſt ardout, ſo that I much frequented the ſhades, and made my jorney through the thickeſt woods, being glad of the benefit of the ſhadow-caſting trees. I had paſſed two dayes in my journey without any adventure, but the third being entred a wood, whoſe umbrage gave ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigeration, I ſlackned my pace, and ſeeing a fair tree, whoſe branches being ſpread with broad leaves, and ſo thick that it denied entrance to <hi>Phaebus,</hi> made an opacous dormitory on the verdant graſs; Being invited by ſome deſire of reſt, I deſcended my horſe, and tying him to a ſhrub, gave him the liberty to crop the graſs, whilſt ſleepy <hi>Somnus</hi> caſt me into a repoſe. I had not ſlept long under thoſe cooling ſhades, but the ſudden neying of my horſe awaked me, doing me a greater pleaſure then that of <hi>Dariu</hi>'s did him when he was choſen King, for I found the naked ſword of my irritated <hi>Roman</hi> ready to light upon my undefended head. Fear of ſo ſudden danger made me forget my wonted ceremonies, for I was forc't to take my adored buckler, and hide my head which ſuſtained the blow, that elſe had perpetrated my life. I gave him no time to ſtrike a ſecond, but riſing with that agility which my preſent danger requir'd, I immediately drew for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. <q rend="margQuotes">"Coward (ſaid I) unworthy the name of a <hi>Roman,</hi> I had not thought thy degenerated ſoul would have done ſo baſe an action, but thy puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous heart feared to ſee me waking.</q> He anſwered not but with his blows, whilſt I gave him more than he deſired, my extream anger at the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his action made me do my beſt to kill him: his skill had not ſav'd his life, nor had my paſſion ſpar'd it, had he not (being brought to the laſt exigent) begg'd it with many words. I was ever apt to forgive, and letting him riſe, <hi>I</hi> told him the conſequencies of ſuch treacherous actions were alwayes contempt, infamy, ſcorn, diſregard, and revenge both from gods and men, on ſuch as uſe them. He told me how perſevering he had been in watching for ſuch an opportunity, having vowed to ſacrifice my life to his juſt reſentments, but he then ſwore ne're to ſeek my hurt any more, forgiving the injury I had done him in taking away his ſhield, being I had ſpar'd his life.</p>
                  <p>This evenement being paſt, I proſecuted my journey, and at laſt without any other adventure worth our obſervance, I drew near <hi>Spain.</hi> I preſently heard of the war that was made againſt the <hi>Auſturians, Cantabrians</hi> and <hi>Gallicians</hi> which made me haſten my jorney, deſiring to help them for <hi>Amenia</hi>'s ſake. For a more ſpeedy paſſage, I caſt my ſelf into the arms of the ſea, and with proſperous gales arrived amongſt the <hi>Austures.</hi> I haſted to <hi>Auſturica</hi> hoping to gain a ſight of that fair one whoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhadow had already made me her captive. Enquiring for <hi>Lilibilis</hi> I underſtood he was then in <hi>Auſturica,</hi> intending with all ſpeed to appear at the <hi>Randezvouze</hi> with ſome auxiliary troops that he had raiſed. This <hi>Lilibilis</hi> was a valiant perſon, and honeſt enough, only he lov'd to rob, and ſpoil his Neighbours with war, which was the general fault of thoſe <hi>Luſitanians,</hi> but now joyn'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51633:19"/> together againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> I reſolved to proſecute my intendments, and as ſoon as I came to <hi>Auſturica</hi> I enquired for <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> and being brought before him, <q rend="margQuotes">"I told him the great deſire I had to do him ſervice in thoſe wars had brought me to <hi>Auſturica;</hi> and how that I accounted it as great a glory to oppoſe the riſing power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as I ſhould have accounted it a ſhame for me to have oppos'd them in the defence of their juſt liberties. I ſaid I was a ſtranger, and intereſs'd in neither Nation, only a deſire of glory and honour made me ſo voluntarily offer him my ſervice; I bid him reward me according to my deſerts, and make me happy by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding me as his ſervant.</q> And ſhewing him the Shield with his daughters portraiture, <q rend="margQuotes">"I further told him, the impudency of a <hi>Roman</hi> Captain his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in bearing that portraiture, had caus'd me to make him ſurrender it for the ſave-guard of his life, that I might pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that he ſhould endeavour for encouragement to others to reanſwer ſuch merits.</q> Many other generous words he uttered which ſhewed that ability which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his Lordſhip, but at laſt that which I moſt lookt for and deſired he told me, <q rend="margQuotes">"that immediately I ſhould go and preſent the ſhield to his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which he knew would be welcome in regard of her great hatred to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Immediately a maid of hers, who of all others was moſt deare to</q> 
                     <hi>Amenia,</hi> gave her notice of my arrival, and of the paſſages betwixt <hi>Lilibilis</hi> and I; and ſet me out extraordinarily more than I deſerv'd, that <hi>Amenia</hi> prepar'd her ſelf to give me a good reception. What I ſhall tell you (ſays <hi>Euripides</hi>) concerning <hi>Amenia,</hi> of thoſe things which were done unknown to me then, ſhe afterwards related to me when the bonds of <hi>Hymen</hi> had bound us together, however I relate it now, which otherwiſe would make the ſtory lame. Many beauties deſire to captivate, although they intend no favours to their ſlaves, and 'tis a general humour in women to deſire to be eſteemed, and to ſee others lives depend upon their wills, that they may tyrannize over their captivated hearts; and the more a man is eſteem'd the more they deſire to have him ſubject to themſelves. <hi>Amenia</hi> was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether free from this vain-glorious humour, for, conſulting with her glaſſe, ſhe ſought to illuſtrate thoſe attractions, which without any adornments were able to captivate, and leaſt of all had ſhe needed it for me, who was before captivated by the dim luſtre of her ſhadow. Whilſt <hi>Lilibilis</hi> conducted me into a garden wherein were many arbours, <hi>Amenia</hi> following, convey'd her ſelf into one of thoſe ſhadowy places, and viewing me through the leaves conſidered my dimenſions. Thoſe ſmall attractions (which age now hath conſumed) that then accompanied me, made her ſpend ſome time in that umbratick intuition. Love who is moſt commonly in a ſwift motion found an entrance through thoſe verdant windowes, and taking poſſeſſion of thoſe open gates which give entrance to the heart, he ſoon deſcended into the more intrinſecal parts of that fair ſtructure. For the eyes being the chiefe advantages of <hi>Cythera</hi>'s ſon, he there makes his occult entrance, and having gain'd the Fort afterwards playes the tyrant. This Quiver-bearing god ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wounded us both with his golden dart, made very much for my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for if I ſeem'd any thing hanſom, he preſently exihibited it through a multiplying glaſs, and made the leaſt mole-hill of parts ſwell to a mountaine of perfection. So that whatſoever my actions were, in her eyes they were altogether compleat. After ſome time ſhe left the Arbour, and being ſent for by <hi>Lilibilis</hi> ſhe approached us. We know ſome little grace in a face
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51633:20"/> otherwiſe not very taking, gives ſome attractions according to the ſmalneſs of its meaſure, but a face beautifi'd with due ſymmetry, colour, and lively eye, is a far greater charm, and gives more vigorous attractions: But what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable delight is there in beholding a face, wherein nature with a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal hand hath beſtowed thouſands of faſcinating attractions? and to ſhew her curious skill depainted thoſe flouriſhing colours that 'tis impoſſible for art to immitate. If I found ſuch attractions in her inanimate effigies, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conceive me raviſhed from my ſelf at her ſight, that paſſed her ſhadow by thouſands of degrees.</p>
                  <p>You are not able to conceive, nor I to utter, the raviſhing content I took in beholding that approaching glory: my eyes ſtedfaſtly fixing themſelves on her, gave the victory to the bluſhing roſes in her cheeks. The ſuſcitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that incomparable virmilion added new luſtre to her former ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. Not forgetting my ſelf I did her reverence, and ſetting one knee to the ground. <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>Madam</hi> (ſaid I) I have taken the boldneſs to preſent you your own ſhadow, having reſcued it out of the hands of an unworthy <hi>Roman.</hi> I did not think it fit an enemy ſhould carry it as a trophie of his victory, though I believe himſelf was ſubject to the image. Had he had your conſent for the favour, I ſhould have accounted it a ſacriledge to have rob'd him; but knowing the contrary by himſelf, I thought it your right and not his. I therefore humbly lay it at your feet, and implore your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for this preſumption.</q> I ended with a profound reverence, when ſhe reply'd, extending her hand to raiſe me up. <q rend="margQuotes">"Sir, the <hi>Romans,</hi> who ſeek to uſurp our Liberties, and hope to ſubject us to the yoke of ſervitude, are ſo odious in my eyes, that I account the taking away this ſhield no ſmall obligement, and ſhall accept of it with thanks.</q> Here <hi>Lilibilis</hi> told <hi>Amenia</hi> that ſhe ſhould do better to return it me for my defence, ſince I intended to ſerve him in the Wars againſt her enemies, and that it was great reaſon ſince I had won it ſo fairly, that I ſhould wear it by her favour and permiſſion, under the notion of her champion.

I receiv'd it with that joy cannot be expreſs'd, kiſſing her fair hand, which injected new flames into my breaſt, I roſe up with a ſatisfaction as ample as my wiſhes. We returned into his Palace, my eyes following the attraction of <hi>Amenia,</hi> and feeding, nay almoſt ſurfeting on that delicious object. My content was but ſhort, for the next day we departed with thoſe new Auxiliaries, hearing that <hi>Caeſar</hi> approached the body of our Army. <hi>Amenia</hi> gave a pleaſing mine all the time I was in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. She might have read by ſad deportments with what regret I left her company, and ſhe found her ſelf toucht with no ordinary penſiveneſs at my departure. <hi>Lilibilis</hi> aſſigned me a command in thoſe new rais'd forces, truſting much to my fidelitie. There was to have been a general Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſe of the <hi>Auſtures, Gallicians</hi> and <hi>Cantabrians,</hi> but <hi>Auguſtus</hi> who came himſelf into <hi>Spain</hi> to make a finall conqueſt of that countrey which had coſt <hi>Rome</hi> ſo much blood and treaſure, had divided his Army, and ſent part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Catabrians,</hi> and part againſt the <hi>Gallicians,</hi> and the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd to oppoſe us. <hi>Lilibilis</hi> being a good Captain, performed every thing requiſite thereto. I ſhall not (proceeds <hi>Euripides</hi>) relate the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and encounters in this War, but give you a brief relation of the ſucceſs as far as it appertains to this relation concerning my ſelf. The War was vigoruſly followed on both ſides, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> found it full of trouble and difficulty, and his oppoſers reſolute men, fighting for that Liberty which as yet they had not loſt. The <hi>Cantabrians</hi> and <hi>Gallicians</hi> on each ſide of us, did many brave exploits, which animated our <hi>Auſtures</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:51633:20"/> to exhibit the like valour. When <hi>Caeſar</hi> had the better, thoſe impregnable bulworks fram'd by nature hindred his purſuit, for our men acquainted with the wayes, could enter thoſe precipices without danger, where if the <hi>Romans</hi> ſought to follow, they were either taken in ſome ambuſhment, or ſwallowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live into unreturnable Caverns. We had divers conflicts with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> where to get a fame I oft times ran moſt imminent danger, and received many ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounds. However I gain'd that I ſought for, and I was known to both the Camps. <hi>Lilibilis</hi> daily profeſſing new teſtimonies of his Love for the ſervices I did him. The ſhield whereon <hi>Amenia</hi> was portrai'd I ſtill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried as an Enſign of glory. I had cauſed a fine thin plate, which ſtood hollow from the ſhield, and cut all over in fine works, to be nail'd on it, which ſav'd it from the ſwords of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and yet exhibited her effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies through the gravings. Oft times when any ſmall truce was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, Love and vain glory caus'd me to challenge the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to perform many a ſingle duel againſt ſome of their chiefeſt Champions. <hi>Lilibilis</hi> ſought to hinder this, profeſſing that in my loſſe he ſhould finde his ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I will not glory in my own actions, but the deſire that I had that my fame might reſound in <hi>Amenia</hi>'s ears, caus'd me with ſo great animoſity to break into the troops of my enemies, that giving life and courage to the <hi>Auſtures,</hi> I oft times enforc't them to a victory, and by my example gave puiſſance to their arms. It was a reaſonable encounter, when chuſing out a hundred of the chiefeſt of <hi>Lilibilis</hi>'s Camp, we attacqued a thouſand of the <hi>Romans</hi> well appointed, and put them to a ſhameful flight; which extreamly irritated <hi>Caeſar</hi> to ſee his Eagles flie backwards, but neither his anger nor endeavours could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the loſſe, nor ſave his men from a miſerable ſlaughter.

I immediately caus'd every thing to be prepared againſt a time which I had prefixed, and publiſhed a running a Tilt in the City. Whilſt every thing was preparing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51633:21"/> for theſe ſports, I gave continual aſſaults to that ſpecious fort with my eyes, not daring as yet to come ſo near as to prove its ſtrength with the engine of my tongue, for fear of a repulſe, and loſing that ground I had gain'd, not knowing the deſire my amiable enemy had for an aſſault, that the Fort might be rendred with honour. Thoſe favours ſhe ſhew'd me were with ſo great diſcretion, that I could not diſtinguiſh whether ſhe favoured me as a Lover, or for thoſe ſervices I had done her father, for thoſe ſhots which went from my eyes, could not but declare me an amorous foe. Neither could I perceive that ſhe manifeſted any more ſignes of Love than <hi>Clotuthe Lilibilis</hi>'s wife, who was a young Lady, and married to him ſince the death of <hi>Amenia</hi>'s mother, and indeed too young for his years. My deſigns being nothing but what were truly honourable, I reſolved after thoſe publick paſtimes to exhibit my paſſion with a more apert language than that of the eyes. <hi>Euripides</hi> was about to proceed, not minding the ſtealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the time, when one whoſe misfortunes had made a companion to him in his ſolitary life, came into the Grove to look him, but unexpectedly finding a Cavalier with him in diſcourſe, was about to return, had not <hi>Euripedes</hi> eſpying him deſired him not to deſcede. <q rend="margQuotes">"I could not imagin (ſaid he being come near <hi>Euripedes</hi>) what ſhould detain you longer than your uſual muſings, the conſideration that you were yet faſting, and the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon far entred made me come to ſeek you, not thinking fortune would have brought me ſo abruptly to trouble your diſcourſe with this Cavaliere. I believe (ſaid <hi>Euripedes</hi>) that you have done him a pleaſure, for I lackt a remembrancer being entred into the diſcourſe of my life (which you are acquainted with) and truly not denoting the elaption of the time, I might have entertain'd him yet longer with it, and it may be to the tryal of his patience. I beſeech you, ſaid <hi>Argelois,</hi> think not that I am weary of your diſcourſe, for if you ſtudied to do me the greateſt injury in the world, you could not find a greater than to debar me of the content I receive in the audition of your fortunes; for my diligent hearkning to the relation of your life, gave me no time to reflect on my own miſeries, and I did not think anothers relation could have eas'd my paſſion.

                  <p>THE day being come wherein I was reſolved to exerciſe the <hi>Trojan</hi> ſports, I gave order for the erecting of certain Scaffolds in the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drome,</hi> for the benefit of the nobleſt Spectators. Every thing being prepared, <hi>Lilibilis</hi> and <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> with <hi>Amenia</hi> mounted one of the Scaffolds, and ſeated themſelves under a Canopy purpoſely erected for them, on the other Scaffolds were ſeated the chief men in the <hi>Signiory</hi> under <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> who held the place of a great Prince. <hi>Auſterica</hi> being almoſt emptied, old, young, rich and poor, men, women, and the youth, filled up the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides of the liſts, all deſiring to ſee theſe ſports that were not uſual amongſt them. I had choſen out a hundred of the ableſt, and beſt accompliſht men in <hi>Lilibili</hi>'s Army, and dividing them to fifty on a ſide, we reſolved to exhibit the form of a battle, having armour from the head to the foot,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51633:22"/> with blunted ſpears, and rebated ſwords. Aſſoon as the Spectators had ſeated themſelves, and one by <hi>Lilibili</hi>'s order proclaimed ſilence to ſtop the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure of the people, we enter'd the liſts, each company at ſeveral gates, having ſcarfs on our arms of ſeveral colours to diſtinguiſh one from the other, when that we ſhould cloſe together. The Captain of the adverſe party was one whoſe valor had rendred the ſtrongeſt and ableſt in <hi>Lilibili</hi>'s Army, in the eyes of all others, and had given notable proofs of it againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> Being placed ready for our firſt courſe, the Trumpets gave us the ſignal to charge. The place being ſpacious, we met with a moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſhock, and the noiſe that the breaking of the ſtaves, with the ratling of the armour made, ſeem'd an exact Counterfeit of great <hi>Joves</hi> tonation. Almoſt half of each party kiſt the earth at this carreer; it fortuned that I gained the better of my adverſary the other Captain, by unhorſing him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in truth his encounter was ſo conſiderable, that I lackt but little of the ſame fortune. I immediatly caſt my eyes upon the fair <hi>Amenia</hi> to fetch new vigor, and ſeeing ſhe obſerved my actions, it inflam'd me to my advantage, and the ſecret operation of her beauty, now illuſtrated with a mighty ſplendor, ſo elevated my ſpirits, that if all the company had been to encounter me with ſharp weapons, they ſeem'd too ſmall in my eyes to raiſe my ſelf any glory by their conqueſt, before one ſo ſuperex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling in beauty. Thoſe that were diſmounted ſoon gain'd their horſes, and drawing our rebated weapons, we furiouſly aſſaulted each other, glory cauſing us as if we had been mortal enemies to endeavour each others over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. The firſt charge was with ſo much animoſity, that many felt ſhrode bruſhes, though they were not cut becauſe of the hebetude of our weapons. My greateſt ambition was to gain a gracious aſpect from <hi>Amenia,</hi> for I car'd not if all Spectators had been abſent beſides her ſelf, and that ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was enough to induce me to actions truly glorious; thoſe that never had a Miſtriſs, can never tell what it is to perform any thing in her ſight, the intuition of parents, kindred, or friends contributes great animoſity to a Combatant, but the eyes of a Miſtriſs makes him do wonders; I confeſs ſhe made me glorous by contributing vigor for the performance of thoſe actions, which had elſe been impoſſible for me to atchieve. Our encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was in jeſt, and friends and brothers oppoſ'd each other, but when that every one was throughly heated, the deſire of glory made them forget the remembrance of friends; and the animoſity and great vigor wherewith they proſecuted each other, exhibited them as mortal foes, and had they not had obtuſed ſwords, I think all had dyed in the encounter; I was ſorry I had begun it when I ſaw with what vigor they proſecuted it, and yet my ſelf gave them example, but at laſt the blew ſcarfs, (which was the ſignal of my men) had gain'd the better, moſt of the yellow, our oppoſers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humbled on the ground with bruſes as bad as wounds which enter the fleſh. At laſt we perfected our Conqueſt, and had the glory of the victory accompanied with great ſhouts and complaudings of the people. <hi>Lilibilis</hi> took great content in our performances, and applauded thoſe that had done well. My actions which were particulariz'd by <hi>Amenia,</hi> wrought as I could deſire on ſo gentle a ſoul, and the means did not fruſtrate my hopes, I cannot ſay it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, but it augmented thoſe flames ſhe cheriſht for my ſake, and preſerved thoſe inclinations ſhe had to me from all thoughts of a future change. <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuthe</hi> in the time of our ſportive combate (as <hi>Amenia</hi> afterwards told me) denoting my actions with a partial eye, paſſed extraordinary praiſes in my behalf, the which did but the more ſufflate her flames to whom ſhe uttered them, ſhe accounting them but as due to my merits, perceived not the others inclinations in the uttering them, nor could ſhe have been juſtificable, if ſhe had had any thoughts of her, that had ſuch ties to the contrary.</p>

After the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this ſport were departed with knocks, falls, bruiſes, ſome lame, moſt receiving ſome hurt or other, I went to <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> where I received precomiums befitting his accompliſhments not my merits, But when I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the content <hi>Amenia</hi> had taken in the ſight of theſe ſmall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, ordain'd purpoſely for her ſake, I ſought to continue them, and therefore begg'd <hi>Lilibilis</hi> to authorize thoſe ſports a day or two more with his preſence. I found him not difficult in granting a thing he deſir'd, which made him give notice of their continuance. The next day the place being fill'd as the day before, I entred the liſts, armed with a flame coloured armour, the lower part ſeem'd like glowing coales, whoſe flames compaſs'd my whole body, and many rich ſtones artificially placed ſeem'd the ſparks which proceed from the fire, my Cask was covered with a plume of feathers ariſing like ſmoke out of thoſe flames, and falling in curles ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near the colour of ſmoke, made the flames ſeem more to the life. At a diſtance they thought a flame of fire had entred the place, but managing my courſer to the upper end of the liſts, I did obeſance to <hi>Lilibilis</hi> and the Ladies, placing my ſelf ready to receive thoſe who would oppoſe me. I had ordered this ſingle running with ſpears, that thoſe whoſe actions were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that glory might the better be denoted by <hi>Amenia</hi> and all the reſt of the ſpectators.

At the ſecond encounter I laid a foundation to my glory by his fall. I will paſs over the particular actions of that day, as not much to the purpoſe, and only tell you, the gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly favouring me with the helping vigor infuſed into my ſoul, by the beauty and ſight of <hi>Amenia,</hi> ſo far enabled me that I erected a trophie of glory to my ſelf by the fall of all thoſe who encountred me that day. The next day was to be imployed in the ſame exerciſes, which gave a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the ſpectators, and raiſed my glory with thouſands of applauſes, but I muſt truly tell you I affected none but thoſe of <hi>Amenia,</hi> which were as many and as great as could be expected from one of her quality, and great modeſty. But <hi>Clotuthe</hi> gave me ſuch encomiums, doing me ſo great favours, that I bluſhed, and partly repented that I had done any thing whereby they might have any cauſe to attribute that to me, which I knew my merits did not deſerve. <hi>Clotuthe</hi> ſtudied occaſions to hold me in diſcourſe, gave me a very pleaſing mine, put forth many ambiguous and quaint expreſſions, paſſed many amiable looks upon me, and ſought all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of doing me any pleaſure, more than ever I perceiv'd her to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but my opinion of her great virtue made me paſſe favourable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations on all her actions, and thought thoſe unuſuall favours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the content ſhe received in the ſports exhibited by my meanes.</p>

There ſeems mighty difference in the actions of love, in ſome he ſeems to be the cauſer of vice, in others the cauſer of vertue, which hath made ſome account him as they have ſeen his effects, whether good or bad, which difference is not to be imputed to the nature of Love, which is conſtant, pure, and unchangable of it ſelf,

He cauſ'd him therefore to be had to his Pallace, and gave order for the cure of his wounds. He could not underſtand by his ſervants what was the cauſe he ſought my life, but only that <hi>Mandone</hi> had given them a charge to be in a readineſs, and when they ſaw him ſlain, (not elſe to ſtir) not to let me eſcape alive: for hearing reports of my valour, he doubted his ſtrength, yet he charged his men not to fall upon me till they were ſure he was ſlain.

                  <p>My Rival paſſed his time with no leſs torment, for ſhame and diſpight in being overcome by me, and his manifeſt treachery making him odious to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny generous ſouls, fill'd him with anxiety.

                     <hi>Clotuthe</hi> viſited me every day, ſitting ſometimes an hour or two upon the ſide of the bed, where ſhe ſhed ſo many tears, and expreſſed her ſelf with ſo many obliging words, that I could not but repeat the gratefulleſt words I could deviſe, without very great ingratitude, it made me ſorry to ſee how oblig'd <hi>I</hi> was to her, and how unlikely I was to repay that officiouſneſs which with great affection ſhe expreſſed: I ſought often to recount to her how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy I was of thoſe obligations, and that ſhe debaſ'd her ſelf too much, to render them to one ſo unworthy the leaſt favour, ſhe always anſwered me with ſo much modeſty, that though her actions teſtified a great affection her words never betrayed them, but in the midſt of ſadneſs ſhe often gave a cheerfull look, and whilſt tears trickled down her cheeks, ſome ſmiles ſeem'd to comfort me, which exhibited a deploring my condition, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing that ſhe ſuffered with me at one time; all this I took as the effects of her good diſpoſition. However to ballance theſe favours, ſhe did me more ſenſible injuries, for deſiring as much as ſhe could to entertain me alone, ſhe ſought with all diligence to avoid <hi>Amenia,</hi> and to ſee me without her; but <hi>Amenia</hi>'s ſeverity would not permit her to ſee me without her mother in Law, ſo that by this means I loſt the ſight of her, who had preſerv'd my life by her viſits, <hi>Amenia</hi> at laſt perceiv'd her mothers ſpightfulneſs, and was much troubled at it, which made her the narrowlyer to vigilate her actions, and miſtruſted that which at that time I did not perceive. <hi>Amenia</hi> when ſhe fail'd of coming her ſelf, ſent <hi>Melanthe</hi> to ſee how I did, and to excuſe her abſence. <hi>Lilibilis</hi> likewiſe every day rendred me a thouſand teſtimonies of his goodneſs, and expreſſed a wonderfull trouble at my weakneſs. I ſhould be too tedious and too long to tell you all the ſpeeches, and the ſeveral viſits they all gave me, during this weakneſs, it is enough to tell you the chiefeſt paſſages, and that every viſit <hi>Amenia</hi> gave me, infuſ'd a life into my ſoul, which her abſence took away; her preſence gave me ſtrength, her abſence debilitated me; whilſt ſhe lookt on me I felt no pain, when ſhe ſaw me not I felt no eaſe; when I ſaw her ſhe ſuſcitated a joy, but her departure regave me my grief. Thus I paſſed a week with a ſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, my thoughts ſtill agitating in a violent motion, retarded the healing my wounds, and encreaſed my feaver, the Surgions and thoſe who had me in cure, look'd upon me as one already dead, which begat a great conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the minds of all thoſe that bore me any good will, till then I could not believe I ſhould die, but now I was perſwaded to it through my own debility, which made me reſolve to utter that, which my reſpect till then had made me detain, and to let <hi>Amenia</hi> know the torments I had indured for her ſake, and with what great reſpect I ſerv'd her, in the ſo long concealing of them, I hop'd that my life would end with my ſpeeches, and if that the one begot an anger, the other might ſuſcitate a pity; and if I liv'd to hear her ſentence me for my temerity, yet it would be a happineſs in that her ſelf did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to my death, and that my content would be extraordinary when that ſhe knew I died hers. In theſe thoughts I was when <hi>Melanthe</hi> ſent by her Miſtriſs, came to ſee if I was yet alive, after ſhe had (a little undrawing the Curtain) beheld me in that weak condition, ſome tears which her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration had extracted running down her cheeks, ſhe asked me ſoftly how I did. Turning my head towards her, I asked her if there was any body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51633:28"/> her ſelf in the room, after that ſhe had told me no, <q rend="margQuotes">'<hi>Melanthe</hi> (ſaid I) if thou haſt any compaſſion on my deplorable eſtate, as I am apt to think by the teſtimony of thoſe tears which I ſee thee ſhed, render me one favour before I depart this world, which though it cannot be requited, ſhall yet be preſerv'd as the greateſt obligation you could ever do me, thoſe ſmall moments I have to live. Sir, (ſaid ſhe) let me but know what it is my poor power is able to effect, and I ſhall not be more ready to embrace the greateſt happineſs that could betide me, then I ſhall be to render you that ſervice I am able, though it be to the hazard of my life. I thank'd her with the obligeingeſt terms I could deviſe, and then I proceeded thus. The thing which I ſhall deſire is ſo great, that I cannot acknowledge a greater obligement, it is to diſpoſe your Princeſs to felicitate that ſmall remainder of my life with her preſence, and to do me that favour to make this laſt viſit alone except your ſelf, becauſe I have ſomething of importance to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to her, which till I have done, I cannot depart with my repoſe, this is the laſt and greateſt favour I may ever require, therefore good <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the</hi> if thou regardeſt the repoſe of a man ſo deplorable, let it be quickly leaſt my death prevent this deſired happineſs.</q> 
                     <hi>Melanthe</hi> gave me ſome aſſurance that ſhe knew <hi>Amenia</hi> would not be ſo ungratefull for all my former ſervices done to her father, as to deny me ſo ſmall a requeſt, with this ſhe departed the room. <hi>Amenia</hi> (who made me acquainted with every thing afterwards) received this not without ſome alteration, but ſeeing I was near my end, ſhe reſolved what ever came of it to yield to ſo juſt a requeſt, and to render me ſo ſmal a favour, for all my ſervices done her father, beſides her love to me oblig'd her to comply to ſo ſmall deſires, and not without ſome curioſity to know what <hi>I</hi> had to tell her. <hi>Melanthe</hi> imagined the truth of what I had to ſay which ſhe hid from <hi>Amenia,</hi> leſt (though ſhe deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more) following the ſeverity of her humour, it might have ſtopt her comming. In leſs than half an hours ſpace I ſaw her enter the chamber, with none but <hi>Melanthe,</hi> which gave me great joy, but accompanied with a fear that cauſed a general tremour through out my body. After ſhe had ſeated her ſelf as near my bed-ſide as ſhe could, I look'd upon her with a languiſhing eye, which ſeemed to crave het pity to accompany me to the grave, and did not inſenſibly behold that beauty, which as near the grave as <hi>I</hi> was, had power to give me a reſurrection, though <hi>I</hi> expected nor hoped for any ſuch thing. <hi>I</hi> beheld her a while with ſilence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, till <hi>I</hi> ſaw the conſideration of my deplorable condition had drawn ſome tears from her eyes, and then uſhering my words with a ſigh, <hi>I</hi> ſpake to her thus. <q rend="margQuotes">'Madam, <hi>I</hi> have precipitated my ſelf into a boldneſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inexcuſable, could <hi>I</hi> otherwiſe have left the world with repoſe?

                  <p>The winter was almoſt conſumed before I was permitted to leave my Chamber, and in all that time I enjoyed a happineſs not to be paralleld, in the moſt deſired viſits of <hi>Amenia,</hi> my content in her viſitations gave eaſe to thoſe torments which I ſuffered, and the fear of looſing thoſe favours by which I liv'd, as well as the fear I had to tranſgreſs her commands, obſerated my lips, and kept my tongue under a perpetual reſtraint; our talk was moſt commonly on indifferent things, and if at any time I had let ſlip the leaſt word tending to love, or that might make her take notice of my paſſion, my cheeks were left deſtitute of their Rubor, and a trepidation ſeiſed on my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; ſo fearfull was I by tranſgreſſion, to looſe the happineſs <hi>I</hi> enjoy'd. My obedience confirmed me in her breaſt, and gave her moſt terrible cruciations, in that ſhe was reduc'd to an obedience contrary to her inclinations, by the duty ſhe ow'd to her father. This made her ſigh in ſecret, and ſend forth rivers of tears, which would have waſhed away that viviſicent colour that adorn'd her cheeks, had not the comforts of her <hi>Melanthe</hi> ſtopped thoſe ſilver ſtreams in the midſt of their diſtillations.

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:51633:31"/>
                  <p> Thus I had almoſt paſſed over the winter, in the ſweet converſation of <hi>Amenia,</hi> never breaking my impoſed ſilence; when <hi>Lilibilis</hi> had notice given him that the Chief of the <hi>Gallicians,</hi> deſired him with the chief of his men, to meet them on the borders of the <hi>Auſtures,</hi> that they might conſult for the general good concerning their next Campaign, and in what manner they ſhould oppoſe their enemies. They ſent him word that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and had left the Legions with <hi>Antistius,</hi> a valiant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and who with all ſpeed was muſtering his Forces to aſſail them, and to begin the War, though it was ſo ſoon. <hi>Lilibilis</hi> ſoon departed with the chief of his Commanders, leaving a great charge on <hi>Clotuthe</hi> to be carefull of me, and deſired me to contribute what I could to my health, that I might be in a condition to render him that help which he hoped for from me, and on which he depended more than on his Army. I would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to let me accompanie him, but he utterly refuſed it in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that my weaknſſe was not ſo well recovered, but that ſo ſudden a jorney might have thrown me into a relaps. When I ſaw he would not let me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, I told him that I would cherriſh my ſelf, as much as his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence poſſible could give me leave, and that I only deſired my life to looſe it in his ſervice, to which I had deſtinated the remainder of my daies: He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in very civil terms, having nothing of Barbariſm in him, and after our mutual imbraces he departed, leaving me to the care of thoſe, whoſe love had made them uncapable of having their care of my health augmented by his commands or entreaties. The ſecond day after <hi>Lilibilis</hi> his departue, I was ſet in my chamber by the fire in a very deep melancholy ruminating, on the different tyrannies of the God of Love, and conſidering how deeply I was engaged in a paſſion, that had coſt me ſo many tears, and ſo much trouble, and yet had receiv'd nothing but a ſevere Law from the mouth of my goddeſs, when her <hi>Melanthe</hi> ſuddenly entred my Chamber, and ſurprized me in the midſt of thoſe tears, which my ardent paſſion had extracted from my eyes. That Maid whom affection had tied to my intereſts, excuſed her ſo ſudden and uncivil entrance, (as ſhe termed it) with very good language, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd my pardon for her incivilitie. I ſoon made her underſtand how glad I was of her company, and how much I deſired an opportunity of entertaining her alone. She told me ſhe came from her Miſtriſs, who had ſent her to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her, in that ſhe had not ſeen me that day, by reaſon of an indiſpoſition which had made her keep her Chamber. I replyed, I was unworthy the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhe did me in taking ſo great a care of my well-fare, and that I could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the aſſurance of my own death with leſs trouble then to underſtand ſhe was indiſpoſ'd in her health. The Maid reanſwer'd, that there was no fear of any danger in her Miſtriſs indiſpoſition, and that ſhe made no queſtion but that ſhe would viſit me the next day, and pay me intereſt for that dayes neglect; we ſpent ſome time in theſe interlocutions, till at laſt, after I had forc'd her to ſit down, I uttered my ſelf in theſe terms.
<q rend="margQuotes">'<hi>Melanthe</hi> you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant of the cauſe of thoſe tears you have ſurpriz'd me in, which are but a ſmall part to what I dailie and almoſt hourlie offer to a ſeveritie which hath made me mute.

Was there ever ſuch a Law im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on any as is on me? which makes me live in the continual languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my ſoul, and in the dailie converſation and intuition of the object of all my ſuſpirations, and ſtill to lock up my lips by ſeverity not to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel'd. <hi>I</hi> know <hi>Melanthe,</hi> though ſickneſs hath not kil'd me, that grief will,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51633:32"/> if not mitigated by ſome relaxation, but if <hi>I</hi> die, it will be a happineſs in that it is by keeping a Law impoſ'd upon me, by that mouth which <hi>I</hi> ſo much adore, whereby ſhe ſhall ſee <hi>Euripedes</hi> can never be guiltie of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the ſevereſt of her commands. <hi>I</hi> find ſome eaſe in declaring this to thee, what allevament ſhould <hi>I</hi> find in disburdening my ſelf to her? but ſince ſhe hath enjoyned the contrarie, I muſt, <hi>I</hi> will undergo it with ſilence to the death, and laſt expiration of a ſoul totallie hers, and which lives onlie to do her ſervice. She did not bid me <hi>(Melanthe)</hi> to ſpeak of love to no body elſe, therefore I hope I have not tranſgreſſed in ſpeaking to you, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs I deſire you not to make her acquainted with it, leſt her ſeverity may impute it as a tranſgreſſion to me. I dare not ſue, or deſire, O <hi>Melanthe,</hi> to have this impoſition taken off, but you may conceive with what joy I ſhould receive the revocation of ſo ſtrict a Law; but I doubt I am faulty in in that I deſire to have that taken off, which was impoſed by <hi>Amenia,</hi> though it be more grievous, and leſs eaſie to be born than death. Sir, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Melanthe</hi>) your vertues have made me inſeparably yours, as far as the duty I owe my Miſtriſs, and the pudicity of my ſex give me leave: I will not tell you how often I have endeavoured her, to revoke that which ſhe had impoſ'd upon you, and which I ſaw you bore with a patience not to be parralel'd, becauſe my andeavours prov'd in vain to cauſe her revoke what ſhe had once commanded. I know the ſeverity of her humour is ſuch, that ſhe will endure the greateſt afflictions rather than break it; and this ſeverity is very ſtrange which ſhe uſeth towards you, ſtrange in that ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts you whom ſhe deſires not to afflict, and ſtrange in that ſhe no leſs afflicts her ſelf, in that ſhe is ſo ſevere to you, and that her humour is ſo ſtrictly tyed, to the ſeverity of her own Law, that ſhe will rather endure what ſhe ſuffers than break it. She her ſelf hath told you Sir, [therefore I may ſay it without any infidelity to my Lady] that you are not indifferent to her, but being tied by the cruel Lawes of duty, (cruel in that it makes her contradict her own inclinations, and cruel becauſe they will require her death rather than the breach of them) ſhe muſt be obedient to him who hath that Soveraign authority over her, which were it otherwiſe, <hi>Euripedes</hi> might not receive ſo ſenſible afflictions, nor her ſelf ſuch cruciations. If my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel be not too preſumptuous, I ſhould adviſe by no means to break that Law ſhe hath impoſ'd, till neceſſity require it, content your ſelf in that ſhe both ſees, knows and feels your afflictions. If <hi>I</hi> have been too laviſh of my tongue, I doubt not but you will treaſure up in ſecret what <hi>I</hi> have told you that I may not be accuſed of infidelity to her, whoſe ſevere humour could never pardon me. The afflictions I ſaw you ſuffer, ingaged me to let you know this, that from it you might exprome comfort in your greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</q> I could not chuſe but embrace <hi>Melanthe</hi> at the end of theſe words, and give her to underſtand how extreamly ſenſible of theſe obligations I was, both by my tranſports and words. We had a great deal of diſcourſe tending to this matter, whereby <hi>I</hi> found great eaſe in the aſſurance ſhe gave me, that it was not want of affection in <hi>Amenia,</hi> in that I was condemn'd to ſilence, and in that ſhe was ſo ſevere, but only in obedience to the rules of her duty, and dictates of a natural ſeveriety.

                  <p>I Read not this Letter without exhibiting by my face thoſe perturbing paſſions which it ſuſcitated in my breaſt, I a hundred times changed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and my trouble was ſo great that I could hardly accompliſh the reading of it. That geſtatrix perceiv'd my perturbation, yet I believe ſhe knew not whether it preſag'd good or ill, ſhe was about to aſſure her ſelf by words, when <hi>I</hi> cried out. The gods have undone me! <hi>I</hi> expreſſed my affliction by iterating thoſe words often, without being capable of uttering more. Why have the gods undone you? (ſaid ſhe compoſing her countenance as well as ſhe could) <hi>I</hi> rather think they have made you happy, were you able to ſee it, <hi>I</hi> thought what would become of your great proteſtations to do her ſervice when you were tri'd. Woman (ſaid <hi>I</hi> with an angry tone) tell me not of doing her ſervice in ſo unlawful an action, <hi>I</hi> know it would be the greateſt diſſervice <hi>I</hi> could do her, to blemiſh her honour eternallie by illicit actions, the very thoughts thereof are to me more cruel than death, would there were but any occaſion offer'd to do her ſervice, wherein her, nor my honour might be contaminated, you ſhould ſee how willinglie <hi>I</hi> would embrace a death in the performance. <hi>I</hi> honour <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> honour her ſo much, that <hi>I</hi> will firſt loſe my own life before <hi>I</hi> will defile hers, or <hi>I</hi> will baniſh my ſelf this place, ſeeing <hi>I</hi> have made others criminal.</p>
                  <p>After theſe words <hi>I</hi> walked a turn or two, in a very confuſed poſture, and then ſtopping ſuddenlie with an action not to be expreſſed, <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe (ſaid <hi>I</hi> looking again on the letter) that <hi>Clotuthe</hi> can be guiltie of this letter; the virtuous <hi>Clotuthe</hi> could never do it, this is ſome plot of my enemies to beguile innocent <hi>Euripedes,</hi> but O my enemies, you ſhall never intrap him in ſuch illicit actions. The woman ſeeing me ſo tranſported, had not the confidence to interrupt me, but hearing me go on in this, ſhe at laſt fell into a thouſand proteſtations, adding innumerable oaths, calling all the gods to witneſſe that it was no deſign of my enemies, and that it was onely <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> who waited but her return to receive her death, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe deſired me to take pity on her, and remember how careful ſhe had been of me, and that I ſhould not cauſe the death of the fair and amiable <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuthe</hi> by ſtanding upon a fooliſh point of honour. <hi>I</hi> was ſo moved that <hi>I</hi> heard not many other words that ſhe ſaid. Ah would the gods (at laſt cry'd <hi>I</hi> out) had verified my hopes, and have given me no cauſe to complain againſt <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> by letting it have been a plot of my enemies, with how much leſs trouble could <hi>I</hi> have bore it, and with what ſhame ſhould <hi>I</hi> have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded my enemies. Think not by your perſwaſions (ſaid <hi>I</hi> turning to the woman) nor by your implorations to gain me to that which muſt be a ſpot of infamy to us both eternallie. Have <hi>I</hi> received ſo much kindneſs, ſo much honour, ſo much love from <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> and ſhall <hi>I</hi> abuſe it with ſo great deceit, ſo much vileneſs, and ſo great an abuſe, as to defile his bed? the gods cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51633:33"/> would dart thunders upon my head, and the great God of Hoſpitalitie would Eternally plague me, ſhould I be guiltie of ſuch a thought. O <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuth,</hi> would, inſtead of preſerving it, you had abandon'd this life to ruin, then had I never been guilty of hearing this propoſal, nor it may be you altogether ſo criminous. O <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> how well indeed ſhould I requite your favours, by doing you the greateſt of injuries! To defile <hi>Clotuthe</hi> and diſhonour my ſelf for ever: No, no, ceaſe to urge me to ſo great a crime. That impudent woman replied thus: <hi>Sir,</hi> I did not think you would have been leſſe generous in this action for <hi>Clotuthe</hi> than you have been in all things elſe, if you conſider her love, and life, they will bear down thoſe weak reaſons you alledge. For, what diſhonour or infamie can it be, to love her whoſe love is ſo unparallelable, and when none in the world elſe can diſcover it, and when you receive an affection, that any in the world beſides your ſelf, would account a happineſſe, to be envied of the Gods themſelves? That reaſon of Honour is nothing, it being but an outſide, and can receive no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain but in the eyes of others, which cannot be procured by this, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. Beſides, in my mind that is the greateſt honour whereby we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive proofs of it from others, to the advantage of our ſelves, which you do in this, the other being but imaginarie, this real, though ſecret. But if ſhe is willing to forgoe that point for you, why ſhould you be ſo ſcrupulous as not to do ſo much for her? ſeeing ſhe lives not but by being yours, why then ſhould you refuſe to be hers? Nevertheleſs, if her love cannot move you, let the conſideration of her death cauſe you to pity her, if I grant you that it is a crime (which can hardly be thought ſo, ſeeing the Gods themſelves have authoriz'd it by their own actions); think, whether it be not a greater crime, to cauſe her death by ſo much rigor, than to preſerve her life with ſo much eaſe, and pleaſure to your ſelf. Fear not that the Gods will puniſh that, which themſelves are examples of, no, they are too juſt to do ſo; and as for <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> it would be far greater indignitie to deſtroy <hi>Clotuthe</hi> for all his favours, than to ſave her life with no wrong to him, eſpecially being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. Conſider, I beſeech you, her death is inevitable, and if you refuſe her, her ſhame will not let her live. Oh, be not ſo hard-hearted, if you cannot do it with complacencie, force your ſelf to ſave a life, which elſe will be lai'd to your charge.</p>
                  <p>I admire how <hi>I</hi> heard her ſo long, but ſhe had proceeded farther if <hi>I</hi> had not put an end to her ſpeeches; my choler being rais'd to the height: Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (ſaid I, my face ſhewing my reſentment) wert thou not of that ſex; which would be a diſhonour to me to hurt, I would cruelly chaſtiſe thee for theſe ſpeeches: <hi>I</hi> know <hi>Clotuthe</hi> never gave you ſo large a Commiſſion to treat as you do, her Letter though it be criminal, is not ſo inverecund. I believe ſhe her ſelf would puniſh thee if ſhe knew it, and be aſhamed of what thou haſt ſpoken in her behalf: being thou belongeſt to her whom <hi>I</hi> truly honour, I force my ſelf to forget what you have ſaid, that you may not appear before me as a Monſter. Tell <hi>Clotuthe</hi> that it is impoſſible for me to be ingratefull, but I cannot ſatisfie her no other wayes, than by laying my life at her feet: if ſhe looks for other ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I have none; however, I will be ſo carefull of her Reputation, that even my ſelf will forget that ever I received ſuch a Letter from her, that ſhe may not appear criminal in my thoughts. Tell her, I would come to viſit her, but that I doubt my Companie would be but a diſturbance, and ſuſcitate thoſe motions which I deſire my abſence may baniſh, and make her incur danger of diſcovering to others what her prudence hitherto hath hid, and which rather than it ſhould be known my life ſhould expire at her feet. With theſe words I left the Woman, and entring a Cloſet in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>I</hi> gave her leave to depart.</p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:51633:34"/>
                  <p> There I call'd to my remembrance <hi>Clotuthe's</hi> former kindneſſes, her ſpeeches and paſt actions, and with what fervency and care ſhe performed many things for me, I could then perceive there was a paſſion in all ſhe did, and her ambiguous ſpeeches were now manifeſted, and in fine I wondred that I could not perceive it all that while, being openly enough exhibited, but I was ſo far from thinking of yielding to her, that the more I thought upon her, the more odious ſhe ſeem'd to me, and in conſideration of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> I rather began to hate her than love her. My thoughts likewiſe exhibited to me the great trouble and vexation was like to enſue if ſhe perſiſted in it, but if my diſdaine ſhould cauſe her hatred, as it was very likelie it ſhould; I ſaw on that hand as great danger and trouble as might be on the other; I fear'd nothing but ruining my pretentions for <hi>Amenia,</hi> by ſtratagems never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inraged women.

A thouſand thoughts came thronging into my mind all repreſenting ſome diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to enſue, and methought this evement had already ruined my hopes. I complain'd againſt the gods, inveigh'd againſt <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> ſpoke againſt my ſelf, and in theſe tranſports I ſpent a good part of the night before I came forth of the cloſet. When I was in bed my imaginations hardly ſuffered me to take any ſleep; ſometimes me thought I ſaw <hi>Clotuthe</hi> like a fury aſſailing me, and endeavouring to tuine me, by and by ſhe was repreſented acting part of her reſentment againſt <hi>Amenia,</hi> uſing her with violence and rigor, this gave me real cruciations, though it were but a thought; and made me often exclaim againſt her with the bittereſt words I could invent, then I ſaw her in my imaginations acting her own Tragedy, this caus'd me no leſs feare and trouble on the other ſide, in conſideration that ſhe was the wife of <hi>Lili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis,</hi> whom I very much honoured and lov'd; theſe troubleſome thoughts took away ſleep and reſt, with ſome that love injected for <hi>Amenia,</hi> and I hardly gain'd a ſlumber that night, which alſo was interrupted with dreames of the like nature, thoſe Idaea's exhibiting themſelves in my ſleep.</p>
                  <p>The next day I was viſited by <hi>Amenia,</hi> and her preſence diſſipated part of thoſe troubles which continually employed my imaginations, and gave me that relaxation which nothing beſides her ſelf could do. We paſſed our time as we us'd to do, in very ordinary diſcourſe, and though ſhe lov'd me well, yet had ſhe hardly the confidence to ſix her eyes upon mine when ſhe ſpake, and when ſhe perceiv'd how intentively I beheld her, my eyes taking that libertie which was denied my tongue, it made her bluſh out of the knowledge that ſhe underſtood thoſe dumb orators, yet was ſhe ſo cruel as not to take off her impoſition. At laſt <hi>Amenia</hi> made me acquainted with her mothers ſickneſs, but ſhe knew not the cauſe; ſhe deſired me to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with her to give her a viſit, I was afraid to diſcover it to <hi>Amenia,</hi> by denying to go, and I knew my preſence would do her hurt in conſideration that I was the cauſe of it. I was very loth to do <hi>Clotuthe</hi> ſo much wrong as to diſcover her weakneſs to any, which made me go after two or three times invitation, wherein I could not deny <hi>Amenia.</hi> I was troubled though, leaſt <hi>Clotuthe</hi> might diſcover her ſelf by ſome action that my preſence might cauſe; but my chiefeſt trouble was, leaſt that viſit might give her any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to perſiſt in her love, or cauſe her to believe I would not be altogether averſe from her, or might yield to that which was ſo odious to me. With this trouble I accompanied <hi>Amenia</hi> to <hi>Clotuthe</hi>'s chamber, we found none there but that woman who brought me her letter, for <hi>Clotuthe</hi> deſired few of her other womens companie, being all ignorant of the true cauſe of her grief. After <hi>Amenia</hi> had rendred her what ſhe thought was required from her, and teſtified what ſhare ſhe bore in her egritude by many words
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51633:34"/> full of ſweetneſſe and compaſſion, I approached her bed ſide, but with ſo great fear and trembling, that I could not expreſs my ſelf a great while, her colour went and came very often at my approach, which ſhew'd an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary motion within her. <q rend="margQuotes">'Madam (ſaid I after <hi>I</hi> had ſtood a while ſilent) I cannot yield to any in the world that ſuperiority of having a more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible affliction of your egritude than my ſelf, and <hi>I</hi> cannot believe I injure truth if I ſay I feel little leſſe dolor than your ſelf.

What (ſaid ſhe) ſhall <hi>Euripedes</hi> loſe a life, a life ſo dear to me? ſince I love him, ſince I have prov'd his, and that with the hardeſt proofs, why ſhould I not confeſs it to him? it may be it will make him more careful of it when he knows he cannot loſe it without endangering mine; it may be it will ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate him, that it may be ſome conducement to make him returne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror over out inſulting foe: deter it no longer ſcrupulous <hi>Amenia,</hi> let him know thou accepteſt of his affection.

A little before this laſt dayes approach I exhibited the afflictions of my heart by that trouble which appear'd in my face, and by it <hi>Amenia</hi> read the greatneſſe of my affection and of my ſorrow. She ſaw my life was ready to leave me at this ſeparation, and yet I endur'd her impoſition with a patience not to be equal'd, but by my affection, and that I had reſolv'd to die rather than to break it: this conſideration wrought a compaſſion, joyn'd with her love, that made her reſolve to give me leave to take my leave of her in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, but ſhe was not reſolv'd to make known any affection to me. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthe</hi> let me know the favour <hi>Amenia</hi> intended to do me, and truly in ſpight of all my trouble, this favour gave me a real conſolation. <hi>Lilibilis</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to depart very early the next morning; conſidering the illneſſe of <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuthe</hi> be would not diſturbe her repoſe ſo early, therefore he took his leave of her that night: I was reſolv'd not to take my leave of her alone, leaſt it ſhould have engag'd her into a diſcourſe which I was not willing to hear.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Lilibilis</hi> had taken his leave of her with words and actions full of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and not without many teares, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Go <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides</hi> (ſaid ſhe at laſt) triumph over thoſe enemies, and ſpare them not that would rob <hi>Lilibilis</hi> of his right, it grieves me that I ſhall not live to have a ſhare in your glory. I knew ſhe particulariz'd her ſelf, but the anſwer I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd her, could give her no light that I underſtood her ſo. I made her a very low obeyſance, and left her, but <hi>Lilibilis</hi> hearing her ſpeak of death caſt himſelf again into her armes, from which embraces I ſaw he was not likely ſoon to depart, and having heard he had before bid his Daughter farewell, my impatiencie made me immediately depart to <hi>Amenia's</hi> Chamber, whether I alwayes had a free acceſs. She had diſpoſed her ſelf to receive me kindly, and had none but <hi>Melanthe</hi> with her, I entred not without trembling, for fear I ſhould break at laſt what was impos'd upon me. Aſſoon as I ſaw her I caſt my ſelf at her feet, and embracing her knees fully tranſported, I was not able to utter one word, I remained ſome time in that poſture, till my ingemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated ſighs had clear'd the paſſage for ſome words. <hi>Madam</hi> (ſaid I) this favour is ſo glorious, and ſo far beyond the merits of <hi>Euripedes</hi> that it hath over and above ſatisfied for all trouble, teares and ſighs, which the moſt violent of paſſions, and moſt ſevereſt of Commands have afflicted me with: Ah, how glorious a recompence I find! But, may I <hi>Madam</hi> (continued I trembling and ſhewing that fear which poſſeſt me, by my eyes, and faultring of my ſpeech) may I have leave to break that—. I could not go on through the appehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I had of offending her, but caſting down my eyes I exhibited my ſhame, for going about to tranſgreſſe. <hi>Amenia</hi>'s ſilence gave me liberty to lift up my eyes full of teares to hers, which I ſaw fix'd intenſively upon mine, and to proceed thus. Conſider <hi>Madam</hi> (uſhering them with a ſigh) I am going whether the Gods only know if I ever may return; nay, I ſhall account it no diſaſter, but a glory to die in the ſervice of <hi>Amenia.</hi> If I am troubleſome to her, or if I have offended her, my death will be moſt welcome, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51633:36"/> content me, being her Joy and her Grief are inſeparably mine. But if <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> will out of her goodneſſe, not regarding the meanneſſe of my merits, let me not to be ſo indifferent to her, as to deſire my death, but rather that I ſhould return in ſafety, that alſo confirm'd by her fair mouth, will give me this comfort if I die, that <hi>Amenia</hi> not regarding my preſumption, in exhibiting my paſſion, had out of her abundant goodneſſe pitied me, and not ſeen my death without regret, this will be glory enough for <hi>Euripides,</hi> with that of dying in her ſervice, and would give him no other cauſe of trouble but that of leaving her. Ah <hi>Madam!</hi> (vehemently ſighing again) have I not obſerv'd your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands hitherto, though more terrible than death? how far eaſier had it been for me to have died, then to have obſerv'd this ſilence you have impos'd upon me! muſt I ſtill?—(ſtopping a little, then with a ſupplicating Air) and muſt <hi>I</hi> depart without telling you—<hi>I</hi> dar'd not to proceed, but ſtopping with a fear that ſeis'd me, leaſt <hi>I</hi> had proceeded too far, and ſhould abuſe the favour ſhe did me, <hi>I</hi> fell into a trembling that made her extreamly pity me. My paſſionate words accompanied with more paſſionate actions, and geſtures not to be expreſſed, but by thoſe whoſe paſſions inſpire them naturally, rais'd ſo great compaſſion comitated with that great Love ſhe bore me, that made her ſay more than ſhe had intended; and forc'd her ſeverity to give place. I cannot but admire conſidering the vehemency of her paſſion, (which ſhe proteſted to me afterwards) that ſhe had been ſo long Miſtris of it. Obſerving the trouble I was in, and being mollified with compaſſion, ſhe rais'd me from my knees with theſe words: <hi>Euripedes,</hi> I have bid thee already hope that thou maiſt not be indifferent to me, I do not yet forbid thee to hope it, and I think <hi>I</hi> have in ſome part exhibited it by this reception, though <hi>I</hi> confeſſe <hi>I</hi> owe more to the merits and ſervices of <hi>Euripedes. Euripedes</hi> is going to conquer, <hi>Euripedes</hi> is going to expoſe his life againſt my foes, and to redeem our Liberty with the expence of his own blood; and could <hi>I</hi> do leſſe than give <hi>Euripedes</hi> this favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reception at his parting? <hi>I</hi> would not have <hi>Euripedes</hi> think <hi>I</hi> can take any content at the loſſe of a Life, which I have with all my abilitie endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſave; No, think not <hi>Euripedes</hi> that <hi>I</hi> can part without trouble, and do not believe but the ſweet converſation of <hi>Euripedes,</hi> hath gain'd too much upon my ſpirit, as not to make me extream ſenſible of his loſſe, nothing but the hopes of your return, with victory and more glory than ever, could mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate a lawfull trouble for your departure, therefore by that power you ſay <hi>I</hi> have over you, <hi>I</hi> command you not to expoſe that Life to unneceſſary dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which ſhall be ſtill priz'd by <hi>Amenia. I</hi> have not diſregarded your obedience and you cannot utter more than you have done already: <hi>I</hi> can ſee that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues without your declaring it by words: what need you tell me you Love me, if <hi>I</hi> believe it? (Theſe words tincted her cheeks with a new Vermillion, but ſhe went on without ſtop) <hi>I</hi> have bid you hope, and were <hi>I</hi> not prohibited by the Lawes of Duty, <hi>I</hi> would ſay more, what can you deſire of me <hi>Euripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> is not this ſufficient? She uttered theſe words with her wonted ſweetneſſe, which wrought that effect upon my ſoul, as you <hi>Argelois</hi> being ſo deeply touch't with this paſſion, may conceive in the like caſe. They had caſt me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to extraordinary Raptures, and <hi>I</hi> hardly remembred what <hi>I</hi> did, but caſting my ſelf at her ſeet; though ſhe ſought to hinder it. Ah <hi>Madam</hi> (ſaid <hi>I) I</hi> ſhall find a very different death from what my ſorrows would have caus'd. If <hi>I</hi> expire now it will be in the greateſt content in the world, and will hinder me from ſeeing any more trouble: and were not my Joy mittigated, with the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of leaving you, it would ſo exceed, that it would work the ſame effects as a killing ſorrow. Alaſſe, what is <hi>Euripedes</hi> that you ſhould have thus feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated him? with a more ſenſible happineſſe than if the Gods had plac'd him among themſelves? <hi>I</hi> cannot fear my enemies now, were I to encounter with the whole world. <hi>Amenia</hi> forc'd me to riſe, and ſhedding ſome teares: <hi>I</hi>

You have had ſo much trial of my obedience, that you cannot juſtly doubt but that <hi>I</hi> will loſe my life a hundred times (were it poſſible) ſooner than fail in obſerving them; eſpecially when they are ſo glorious, and contribute ſo much to my own happineſſe. You need not fear that the power of the <hi>Roman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

At the finiſhing of theſe words <hi>Amenia</hi> entring a little Cloſet, faut out a blew Scarſe with a very large fair fringe, all wrought with Gold and Silver, in flowers and other curious work (partly wrought by her ſelf and partly by <hi>Melanthe</hi>) bringing it in her hand; here <hi>Euripedes</hi> (ſaid ſhe) wear this for a remembrance of what you owe me. <hi>I</hi> received it upon my knee, with a world of ſatisfaction: <hi>Madam</hi> (ſaid I) you are too deeply inſculpted on my heart to need any remembrancer, and I am too great an obſerver of your commands to forget them. I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this as the moſt glorious of gifts, and eſteem it above my Life ſince it comes from the hand of my adored <hi>Amenia.</hi> In receiving it I kiſſed it, and being filled with Raptures I cemented my lips to that fair hand, and gave it ſome moſt ardent ſuaviations. She permitted it a little, but believing I treſpaſſed too much upon her modeſty ſhe withdrew it, and raiſing me up, Go <hi>Euripedes</hi> (ſaid ſhe) and conquer where ever thou comm'ſt, and where it is not lawful for thee with thy Armes, uſe thy Virtue and none can withſtand you. Theſe words made me bluſh, but I anſwered: <hi>Madam,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fear to loſe the Victory ſince you have bid me conquer? but I ſhall not glory in all the Victories the Gods can give me, or in being a greater Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſo much as in being your Captive, aye there lies my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and there lies my glory. After theſe words I took my leave, and I ſaw ſome teares drop from <hi>Amenia's</hi> fair eyes at my deceding, which gave me a conſolation not to be uttered, and that night I ſpent in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of my Happineſſe, where I had ſpent many in that of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.</p>
                  <p>I have been longer than I thought to have been (continued <hi>Euripedes</hi>) in the relation of my <hi>Amoretta's:</hi> but the great content I receiv'd in them then, hath conſerv'd them freſh in my memory to this day, though I have paſs'd troubles enough ſince to oblitterate them: if I had had no worſer ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in the latter than in the former I might not perchance have been ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to Love; but thoſe Aerumnal Loves far different than the former, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified my reaſon, and made me ſee with clearer eyes than thoſe of a Lover. Love they ſay is a moſt noble paſſion and leads one to moſt generous actions: true, if you conſider it without that effect of it <hi>deſire;</hi> whilſt that it intereſt's not it ſelf in any thing, but ſolely loveth the obiect becauſe it is lovely; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then it is noble, it is free, and all actions that it produceth are truly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; but if you take Love as moſt do, though you conſider it in thoſe whoſe Virtues were never blemiſh't by it, yet all thoſe actions they exhibit to the world, which may ſeem moſt generous, and moſt noble, are nevertheleſſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51633:37"/> and abject, whilſt deſire as an inſeparable accident accompanies their Love, and makes thoſe actions of ſeeming generoſity to be but the effects of their own deſire, and in all they do, ſerve their own ends. I do not make mention of thoſe whoſe Loves carry them to baſe ends, being converted to Luſt, and to do things odious to them in their right reaſon: youl ſay, that none that are virtuous can be led to ſuch actions: whilſt that Virtue laſts I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe they cannot, but I believe, and know by experience, that this paſſion whereon we treat is able to ſtifle the motions of Virtue, and to inſinuate thoſe of Vice, and make thoſe perſons do that which being clear from this paſſion, they would deteſt, and which could not be attributed to their natures but to the enforcement of their paſſions. Some I know, whoſe Virtues are Eminent, do not yield in the leaſt to their paſſion but overcome it by their Virtue; and though they <hi>Love,</hi> they cannot be ſaid to be ſubjugated by it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſubordinate to their Virtues. I do not ſpeak this without reaſon, and this ſmall digreſſion may be ſome preparative to what I ſhall relate: for, in my firſt Loves <hi>I</hi> acted nothing againſt the precepts of Virtue; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, whether my paſſions were more violent, or leſſe pure, they drew me into actions, that made me juſtly hate both my ſelf, and that paſſion which was the cauſe of them; which when you have heard, though it may not make you hate a paſſion ſo deeply ſetled in you, yet it may excuſe my averſion; in that it caus'd me to do actions ſo deteſtable and unworthy of my ſelf, which hath drew thouſands of teares from my eyes, for ſome ſmall expiation of my follies. But I would not have you think I am an enemie to Love rightly ſtated; for Love is the pureſt ſpark of the ſoul, and that which illuſtrates the whole man, and I may truly ſay that it is the fountain of all good, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it man were not man: ſo the want of it is the chiefeſt cauſe of all evil. But by this I mean that Love which never introduced any deſire, but being an emanation of the gods, acts it ſelf to that which is moſt pure, and doth moſt partake of its eſſence; and I cannot call this a paſſion but a fire taken off from the altar of the Gods; communicating nothing but what is moſt pure and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial, and making the poſſeſſor of it like to the Gods themſelves. In this our two Geniis find a great matter of Conteſtation, for if the one inſpire it, or rather the Gods, and that ſeek to preſerve it, our black Daemon endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſubvert it, and knowing that it is apt to work upon what is fair and like it ſelf, it exhibites beauty and formoſitie, and then ſtirring up a ſenſual deſire contaminates that luſtre, and almoſt ſuffocates that which is the very life of all generous actions. Since I have retired into this ſolitude, I have had time to Contemplate this and many other things, both of the nature of Love, and the effects, and have learn't to ſeparate the droſſe from the Gold: I might declare more of it, but I read an invitation in your face to the proſecution of what is unfiniſh't, concerning my life, and in the end you may perchance perceive that this diſcourſe was not unneceſſarie. <hi>Argelois</hi> would willingly have repreſented his thoughts concerning Love, but being more deſirous to hear the end of his Love and Adventures: he favour'd his proſecution with his ſilence, and heard him proceed thus:</p>

The <hi>Romans</hi> had not ſo eaſily gain'd that Countrey, if they had not oppreſſed them with a Fleet of Ships, which they had tranſported from <hi>Gaule,</hi> for ſeeing it otherwiſe impoſſible to have ſubdu'd them, they with a very great Fleet oppreſs'd them by Sea. The <hi>Cantabrians</hi> having loſt many Victories, and many men, and all their chief Townes taken, they were fain to ſtoop to that yoke which the <hi>Romanes</hi> had impos'd on all the world.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe things were a doing on each ſide of us, you muſt not imagine us idle, or that we had not as ſharp afflictions as the reſt. <hi>Cariſius,</hi> to whoſe lot it fell to conteſt with us, was not encamped far from us. We had at that time a very great Army, compoſed of very ſtout and valiant men, and at leaſt 5000 <hi>Aſtercones,</hi> which did great ſervice in their battels, whoſe velocitie much troubled the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions in all their Encounters: for, diſordering them with a ſudden decurſion, they aſſoon drew off with little hurt to themſelves. We had often called the chief of the Armie to Counſel, that we might not be wanting of Policie as well as valour to defend our ſelves, and that we might not take in hand any thing raſhly, and without the advice of the moſt experienc'd Souldiers; For the want of good Councel is oft-times the overthrow of the moſt valiant, when with temeritie they undertake any deſign. Thoſe actions I had perform'd the Summer before were not forgotten by them, and they did me the honour to call me to all Councels, and to cede very much to what I ſaid. Indeed the provocations of my love, with a deſire that I had to return to <hi>Amenia,</hi> made me extreeamly deſirous to expedite this War; and therefore my councel was all for battel or ſome other valorous Stratagem, that might ſooneſt put a period to it: and in this I did not lack followers among ſo many valiant and hardy men. I at laſt propoſed the attacquing of the <hi>Romans</hi> in their Camp; for that I underſtood by Spies, that they were very ſecure, not being accuſtomed to meet with ſo much valour, as to dare to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſuch an Enterprize. I backed my propoſition with many reaſons which I now remember not, but at laſt it prevailed with them being all very ſtout men, and deſirous of action. For this end the Armie was tripartited, one part was led by <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> the other by <hi>Gurgulinis</hi> a very valiant Captain, and the third they honour'd me with. With great ſecreſie we marched three ſeveral wayes, that we might ſurprize them on all ſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with the more aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, and we came ſo ſuddenly, and were ſo neare them before we were diſcovered, that we had almoſt effected our deſign, which ſhewed our valour that we ventured to undertake ſo difficult an Enterprize. However, we put the <hi>Romans</hi> into great fear, and had we not been diſcovered without doubt we had defeated them, but they had ſo much time as to embattel themſelves,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51633:38"/> and to meet us without their Camp: Nevertheleſſe, they found us aſſured in our countenances, and they were fain to animate themſelves with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their former Victories to keep up their ſpirits. We met with an impetuoſitie that admits of no compariſon, where hundreds of men found their deaths at the firſt Encounter, <hi>Lilibilis</hi> and <hi>Gurgulinis</hi> on each ſide met with the like reſiſtance, and on all ſides the Camp was nothing but blood and ſlaughter.</p>
                  <p>I will not go about to deſcribe a battel to you, who I know have acted your part in many bloody ones: but I am perſwaded the <hi>Romans</hi> never met with a more fierce and ſtout reſiſtance. The earth was ſoon cruented, and ſpread all over with dead bodies, whilſt heaps of men lay groaning out their laſt, which could not be heard through the noiſe of the clattering of their Weapons. It was a diſmal fight to behold how horror ranged throughout the Field, and with what animoſitie each ſide receiv'd their deaths. The ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie of the <hi>Aſtercones</hi> was very uſefull, but neither that, nor the generall valour of the Souldiers, nor the particular actions of the Commanders, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which my ſelf may without vanitie boaſt in having twice unhorſed <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſius</hi>) could keep the invincible <hi>Romans</hi> from the Victorie, though ſhe had long hung in ſuſpence, being accuſtomed to light on the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtandards, ſhe ſo well knew her wonted reſidence, that ſhe reſided there more out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, then that the valour of the <hi>Aſtures</hi> did not deſerve her. Alas, the Genii of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were too weak for thoſe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and I can attribute their gaining of that Victorie to nothing elſe, or their good fortune. Yet the <hi>Romans</hi> had little cauſe to rejoyce for their Victorie, being gain'd with ſo great loſſe, and blood on both ſides: for the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of both, could not make up half the number of one party before they met. We were not ignorant what was done on each ſide the Camp: for we ſoon knew, we all ranne the like fortune, and that the ſame reſiſtance on every ſide had caus'd the ſame internecation.</p>
                  <p>I had trouble enough at the loſſe of this Victory, but a new ſurcharge more afflicted me, when I heard that <hi>Lilibilis</hi> was ſlain upon the place; beſides the affection that I bore the man, I had ſome cauſe to doubt that <hi>Amenia</hi> would vituperate me for his loſſe. <hi>Gurgulonis</hi> with his partie put himſelf into <hi>Lancia,</hi> whilſt I made my retreat with mine to the Mountaines: I got ſome to accompanie me, and adventured, (when the <hi>Romans</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated into their Camp) to fetch off the body of <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> and firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed many teares (due to him, as being my Entertainer, as being the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Amenia,</hi> and as being the valiant and noble <hi>Lilibilis</hi>); Having firſt I ſay beſtowed theſe teares upon his dead corpes, which had received many wounds, I ſent it to <hi>Aſturica,</hi> to <hi>Clotuthe</hi> and <hi>Amenia,</hi> and with it this Letter.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this condition we remained ſometime, reſting in thoſe ſconces after our labours to eaſe and refreſh our ſelves, whilſt I ſent out many of the Officers to collect what forces they could throughout the Countrey. In this time of vacancy, whilſt <hi>I</hi> ſtay'd for the addition of thoſe forces they could get, I had time enough to exerciſe my immaginations on my <hi>Amoret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>'s, and to ruminate very much on thoſe affairs. Such thoughts as theſe eaſed the trouble I had for <hi>Lilibilis</hi> death. If (thought I) that <hi>Amenia</hi> has any inclinations to me, and as ſhe has told me her ſelf, that if by the laws of duty ſhe were not bound to the contrary, ſhe would declare her ſelf more for me, and that I ſhould not be ſo ſeverely dealt withall, may not I believe that the caprichious fortune, hath not dealt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable, in taking away <hi>Lilibilis</hi> who was the only obſtacle of my good? Now ſhe has no duty (which ſhe alwayes pleaded) to fight againſt her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, if ſhe has any to me. Now I ſhall quickly ſee whether thoſe words proceeded from her heart, or only to keep me here for the intereſt of her Countrey. Now her fortune is ſo hazardous, as alſo <hi>Mandone's</hi> that it may be ſhe will ſlie into my arms for protection, and be glad to accept that proffer of leaving her Countrey rather then fall into the hands of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> whom ſhe deadly hates. By and by I ſhould ſay thus within my ſelf, by reflecting upon the goodneſs of <hi>Lilibilis.</hi> Mean ſpirited <hi>Euripedes</hi> thou oughteſt not to admit theſe thoughts to mitigate thy juſt grief for the good
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51633:40"/> 
                  <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> nor is it juſt for thee to build any hopes by his fall; thy love to him which ſhould be built either from his friendſhip or his virtue ſhould not be leſſened by his death, as to make thee forget his memory, and to flatter thy grief with ſuch hopes. What if <hi>Lilibilis</hi> was the only obſtacle of thy happineſs? he was the father of <hi>Amenia,</hi> and thy friend, thou wilt not be ſo impious as to rejoyce at his death, though it enthrone thee in the higheſt felicitie, and to have no other thoughts but to raiſe him from the grave, thou wouldſt forgo all whatſomever thou couldſt pretend to, from thy paſſion, and deny thy ſelf with ſo much magnanimity, for the father of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia.</hi> Thou poorly flattereſt thy ſelf to think that neceſſity will drive <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi> into thy arms, no ſhe is not ſo ignoble as to be conſtrain'd by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, againſt her inclinations, if ſhe has no inclinations to thee, ſhe is ſo high ſpirited as to ſuffer death by her own hands, rather than fall into the hands of her enemies, or to ſeek protection unworthy of her ſelf. If ſhe has inclinations to thee, thou haſt more need to fear, that her high ſpirited humour will both croſſe her ſelf and thee, in not yielding to be thine or accepting of thy protection, leaſt ſhe ſhould ſeem to do it baſely, becauſe ſhe had no other to accept of, and that ſhe yielded to theſe becauſe ſhe could not better raiſe her fortune, and becauſe ſhe had not declar'd it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ſhe doth it now becauſe ſhe cannot avoid it, and that ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes <hi>Mandone</hi> becauſe his fortune is ſpoild, and accepts of thee becauſe thine is entire. And thus <hi>Euripedes</hi> haſt thou moſt cauſe of fear, out of that from which thou raiſeſt thy higheſt hopes, for ſuch thoughts as theſe are enough to hinder thy happineſſe, in the high ſpirited <hi>Amenia,</hi> who can ſtoop to no baſe ends, nor nothing unworthy that noble ſpirit that reigns in her.</p>
               <p>In ſuch like ſoliloquies I ſpent many houres, and ſometimes compleated whole daies in thoſe cogitations, and whatever virtue did to make me not hope for any thing by <hi>Lilibilis</hi> his death, yet could I not chuſe but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that that cruel enemie <hi>Duty</hi> was now aboliſh'd, though to have recall'd <hi>Lilibilis</hi> I would have been content to have run the hazard of the ſame enemie, though I ſaw I muſt have periſht by it, nor could I remember the death of <hi>Lilibilis</hi> without <hi>tears,</hi> nor that <hi>Amenia</hi> was free, without <hi>hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this condition I remain'd till thoſe that conducted the body of <hi>Lili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis</hi> were return'd, they repreſented to me with what dolour it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in <hi>Aſturica</hi> in general, but in particular by <hi>Clotuthe</hi> and <hi>Amenia,</hi> who had ſecluded themſelves from all company, that they might with more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vent thoſe tears due to the death of <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> and that they had ſeen his body interr'd, with much pomp and collachrymation, and that there was nothing but a general conſternation to be ſeen in <hi>Auſturica</hi> ſince his death, wherein they had treaſur'd all their hopes. This news drew tears from my eyes, which was reclear'd by a letter which they preſented me from <hi>Amenia,</hi> and which <hi>Melanthe</hi> had given them, in anſwer to mine, but a little before they came from <hi>Auſturica.</hi> I receiv'd it with much content, and as ſoon as they were gone out of my tent, I fell to kiſſing of that letter and ſhould not have ended in a long time, had not the great deſire I had to know the contents haſtened me to open it: But when I went about it, I could not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair that ſeal <hi>Amenia</hi> had impreſs'd without great reluctancy, but at laſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming theſe niceties, I broke it open and read to this purpoſe.</p>

               <p>You may believe with what joy I read this letter, wherein I perceiv'd I was not indifferent to <hi>Amenia,</hi> and that in the midſt of all her troubles ſhe had conſerv'd a time to think on me, and that her tears had not ſo occupied her, but that ſhe found leaſure to read my lines, and to write to me. If ſhe had been weary of my ſervice, I thought ſhe would not have forbidden me to die in a revenge, wherein ſhe needed not to have car'd what lives had been ſacrific'd, and in a time wherein her intereſts could not plead for me, being there was ſo little hopes that I could accompliſh any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> their power being increaſed with their victories, and ours decreaſed with our loſſes. Once did not ſatisfie me to read this letter, and out of this I conceiv'd great hopes of a future bliſſe, I thought now I might well deprive <hi>Mandone</hi> of his life, without afflicting <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> and rid me of a rival whoſe power I fear'd, but his being engag'd in the wars made me think he could not effect any thing againſt me.</p>
               <p>In the reading and contemplating on that Letter, ſometimes with hope, ſometimes with fear, I ſpent that time which from my troubleſom imployments among the ſouldiers, was given for my repoſe, and till thoſe troops arrived, which were collected through the countrey the <hi>Romans</hi> were not yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of. After the addition of theſe forces, we compleated eighteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and our intent was to relieve <hi>Lancia</hi> which we heard was very much diſtreſs'd, but as we were about to leave our hold for that enterprize, our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorators brought us word that twenty thouſand <hi>Romans</hi> were landed, and came with great ſpeed towards <hi>Aſturica,</hi> and that they were already ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of many places. It was generally approv'd that we were to oppoſe them, and to let <hi>Gurgulinis</hi> defend himſelf from the extremity the <hi>Romans</hi> had reduc'd him to, till we were able to help him, for if we had rais'd the ſiege, which was hazardable, and in the mean time the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould have gain'd the Countrey, it would have been to no purpoſe, but if we had been able to overthrow thoſe new commers, we needed not to feare, but we ſhould much daunt the beſiegers, and animate our men for high enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, being fluſhed with a late gotten victory. We ſaw that on this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter depended the ſafe-guard or deſtruction of the Countrey, which made us animate our men with all thoſe words that uſed to put life and courage into the fearfull'ſt ſoul. We made very long marches till we were come not far from their Camp, they had underſtood of our coming and were
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51633:41"/> reſolved to bid us battel, but we ſtaid within our Camp two dayes without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering their expectations, which they attributed to fear. The next day we reſolved to engage, and to try our fortune by a battel, but that night we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, of the ſurrender of <hi>Lancia,</hi> and that <hi>Gurgulinis</hi> being forced to it by the ſouldiers, the <hi>Romans</hi> very hardly granted him his life for his obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, for he was reſolved never to have yielded; And further, that moſt of that Armie was marching to <hi>Aſturica.</hi> We gave a ſtrict charge to thoſe who brought us this newes not to communicate it to any elſe, for fear of diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſouldiers, but it was quickly known throughout the Camp, for all our endeavours to hide it, and had ſo diſmay'd them that they already began to fear the ſucceſſe. The chief Officers and my ſelf had work enough all that night to reſettle their minds, and to perſwade them to fight the next day. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as it appear'd, having had very little time to reſt, I arm'd my ſelf, and being they were wholly left to my diſpoſe, I drew them out of the Camp, leaving a ſufficient Guard within: and having divided them into two equal parts, I gave the care of one to the beſt deſerver, and one whoſe courage was not ſeen to fail, named <hi>Etruſcis,</hi> and the other I intended for to lead my ſelf. We were in a very ſpacious Plaine, and where no advantage was to be perceiv'd; the <hi>Romans</hi> ſeeing our intentions very readily preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by that time the Sun was up we were ready to joyn. I was very ſenſible that on this battel depended the ruin or renewing of our hopes, and therefore I uſed all the meanes I was capable of, to infuſe courage into their ſoules: and I ſpar'd for no paines that I might accompliſh my deſign, I rode through every rank armed except my head, and ſeeking to ſtirre them up to their dutie, I uttered words ſomewhat to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VAliant</hi> Aſturians: <hi>methinks I ſee in your countenances ſo great a propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to this battel, that I need not uſe words to animate ſuch reſolute men; but being I am honoured with the title of your Captain and General, there ſhall not be any thing neglected by me that belongs to the place. And, though I am perſwaded that I cannot infuſe more courage than you already have, and a more deſire of revenge for the death of your valiant Head then you retain: yet will I put you in mind, that you now ſight not ſo much for glory, riches and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, as you do out of a neceſſity to defend your lives, Liberties, and your Rights: Your renown lyeth not now alone at the ſtake, but your wives, your children, your goods, your houſes, your lands, and that Liberty ſo dear to you, are all now ready to be offer'd up as a prey to your inſulting foe, and your ſelves born a free people to become their ſlaves, if you prevent it not with your own valour, for it is the iſſue of this Encounter that will determine it, which will make you glorious and a terrour to your Enemies, or elſe ſlaves and a ſcorn to your foes. The</hi> Romans <hi>are neither immortal nor invulnerable, but men as you are, and though fortune hath hitherto declared on their ſide, you ought not to fear but Juſtice and your valour will overcome her. If the covetous deſires of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown and riches, can infuſe ſuch animoſity into the</hi> Romans, <hi>ſure this neceſſity of ſaving all that is near and dear to you by your valour, ſhould be more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to infuſe it into the</hi> Aſtures, <hi>the</hi> Aſtures <hi>that are the redoubted of all</hi> Spain, <hi>and that have ſo often foyl'd the</hi> Romans, <hi>and that have ſhewed no leſſe valour and proweſſe then they in all their actions; Let this therefore move you, that your enemies are not many more than you, that your courage equals theirs, that the Juſtice of your cauſe, will oppoſe their fortune, and that not only by this you will redeem your ſelves, wives, children, lands and liberties, but gain a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual renown and hinder the</hi> Romans <hi>from the like attempt, by the powerfull remembrance of your valour; Let this I ſay move you to acquit your ſelves like men, and to declare to all the world that you eſteem your liberties more than your lives; and that you have as much courage to loſe your lives in the midſt</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:51633:41"/> 
                  <hi>of your enemies, as the</hi> Gallicians <hi>who effected their own deaths rather than to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a ſervile life. I will not go about to encourage your generous ſoules with the hope of reward or booty, becauſe theſe more neceſſary conſiderations ought to move you. Beſides, I know your earth plentifully affords you that which makes the inſatiable</hi> Romans <hi>to endeavour your ſubverſion, and to make you their ſlaves for the fulfilling their greedy deſires. There is therefore a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, either you muſt fight it out valiantly, turn your backs cowardly, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the yoke, baſely, or as the</hi> Gallicians <hi>did, turn your ſwords againſt your ſelves, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſperately and wickedly. To turn your backs upon them and to flye, will render you infamous to all the world, and would not ſave your lives from the purſuing</hi> Romans: <hi>but that is ſo contrary to your wonted cuſtome that I fear it not, for I know you know not what it meanes to flye before your enemies, it is impoſſible for the renowned</hi> Aſtures <hi>to be ſo cowardly. But to yield to the yoke of theſe inſulters will brand you with an Eternal infamy, and make you loſe that reputation you have acquired throughout the world; in that with ſo much valour hitherto you have maintain'd your liberty: No, I cannot perſwade my ſelf that you can admit ſuch a thought, having ſpent ſo much blood in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of it, to acquit it ſo baſely and infamouſly, and you cannot think of it being uſed to liberty without ſuſcitating an anger capable to make you conquer the whole world if they went about to deprive you of it. And then if you think of doing as the</hi> Gallicians <hi>did, to run upon your own deaths desperately, you had better expoſe your lives to your enemies, with your weapons in your hands, and ſacrifice theirs with your own, and ſo to die like valiant perſons making thouſands of them to accompany you in your deaths, than to effect it your ſelves and give them leave to laugh at your diſpair. There is no other way then you ſee without cowardize, infamy, and an unworthy precipitation, but that you muſt acquit your ſelves like men, and offering the lives of theſe</hi> Romans <hi>to your just reſentments exhibit to all the world, that it is impoſſible for the</hi> Aſturians <hi>to be conquered, or to yield to the yoke of the</hi> Romans.</p>
               <p>I quickly perceiv'd that my words had wrought the deſired effect upon the ſoules of moſt that heard me, for with chearfull countenances, and great ſhouts: they teſtified how willing they were to ſacrifice their lives for the good of their Countrey, they cryed to me to lead them on, and they would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me even to death it ſelf. At that time obſerving that the <hi>Romans</hi> had us'd the ſame form with us, and that one of their bodies began to move, I put on my Cask, and gave order to <hi>Etruſcis</hi> to joyn. That firſt Encounter was very violent on both ſides, and many were ſlain by the impituouſneſſe of the firſt ſtorm of Arrowes, but being mingled together pell-mell, the Ranks grew thin on both ſides by the deaths of their Companions: our party very valiantly defended themſelves, and for a long time permitted not the <hi>Romans</hi> to gain the leaſt advantage over them, but at laſt I perceiv'd them to retire, when I advanced, and quite altered the face of the battel, but it was not long without another viciſſitude, for their ſecond body coming upon us with ſo impituous a ſhock, that it overwhelmed the moſt vallianteſt, and made the moſt cowardlieſt turn their backs. Our Souldiers were not of the choiſeſt, but compos'd of all ſorts that could be pickt up in that neceſſity, and of thoſe who being forc't had not the heart to withſtand the <hi>Romans,</hi> and theſe freſh-water-ſouldiers hardly withſtood the firſt brunt before they fled and left the reſoluteſt finding their deaths in the midſt of their Enemies, for hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of them eſcap'd that remained to me of the firſt battel, for being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to die or conquer they nobly yielded their lives according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, and had the whole body been compos'd of ſuch men, we needed not to have had the leaſt doubt of the Victorie, For my part, though my actions are not worth the relating yet I gave them no example to ſlye: and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51633:42"/> ſeeing <hi>Etruſcis</hi> ſlain by my ſide, I ruſhed into the very midſt of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in ſpight of all oppoſition I decollated his murtherer amidſt the points of a hundred Swords, but turning my head, and ſeeing the ſhame Fortune had prepared for me by the loſſe of this Victory, I was ſo ſuriouſly tranſported, that nothing beſides that command of <hi>Amenia's</hi> could have deterr'd me from running to have receiv'd my death from the Swords of my Enemies, and as often as I went about to effect it; that ſtrict obſervance to which I had ty'd my ſelf to all her commands hindred the proſecution, and made me ſeek to ſave my life only for fear of diſobeying her; this made me after, having ſacrificed many to my reſentments, to clear my ſelf a paſſage with my ſword, and to eſcape to the adjoyning woods with nine or ten that fought near my perſon: after I had ſeen my men diſperſed, and my ſelf with thoſe few that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me left alone fighting among the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Victory was ſo abſolute that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſlew moſt of them that fled, and ſo diſperſed the reſt, that they could never unite more. I retired to the Woods with nine or ten Horſmen and from thence I went to the next Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, where we found a very ſafe retreat. I did not fight ſo ſlightly in that battel but that I receiv'd four or five deep wounds, which much anoy'd me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my riding. Theſe made me to keep my bed almoſt a month, before I was permitted to leave it, but in all that time I endured moſt heavy Agonies, by the remembrance in what condition that part of the Province was, and how likely <hi>Amenia</hi> was to ſuffer by the <hi>Romans,</hi> I would in the midſt of theſe thoughts often attempt for all the pain that I ſelf from my wounds to leave my bed and to go help <hi>Amenia,</hi> but I was ſtill deterr'd by thoſe attended me almoſt by force. I ſent ſome of thoſe that were with me to enquire after the actions of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and cauſing them to diſguiſe themſelves, I charg'd them to enter <hi>Aſturica,</hi> and to acquaint <hi>Clotuthe</hi> and <hi>Amenia</hi> in what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I was in, and how inſucceſsfull my endeavours had been to their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I would have wrot to <hi>Amenia,</hi> but I was ſo debilitated that I was not able, but diſmiſſing them I awaited their return with much impatiencie, Some dayes after they returned bringing me newes that had almoſt broke my heart; they told me, that being diſguiſed they entred <hi>Aſturica</hi> with much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie, being full of <hi>Romon</hi> Souldiers, for aſſoon as <hi>Lancia</hi> was taken they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached <hi>Aſturica,</hi> and thoſe who were left to guard it; conſidering their own weakneſſe, and the advantage the <hi>Romans</hi> had over them, abandoned it quite, and ſav'd themſelves by flight, ſo that the <hi>Romans</hi> found no reſiſtance, but committing all manner of villanies had turn'd that gallant City into nothing but confuſion. In that confuſion they made a dilligent ſearch after them I ſent them to, but they could not hear any thing what was become of them, they were about to return, when one of them who knew that Woman who was only the depoſitary of <hi>Clotuthe</hi>'s love to me met her by chance, making themſelves known to her, they told her the Commiſſion they had from me, and that they deſired the favour to ſpeak with <hi>Clotuthe</hi> and <hi>Amenia.</hi> They certified me that this Woman ſeem'd very joyfull at their meſſage and that I was alive; ſhe bid them to follow her and they ſhould obtain their deſires, ſhe conducted them to a ſtrong Tower at the further end of the Pallace, where was a great guard of <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers, ſhe left them without for ſome time, and then returning with the Captain of the Guard, ſhe conducted them to <hi>Clotuthe</hi> whom they found in teares for thoſe conſiderable loſſes ſhe had ſuſtain'd, and though ſhe ſeem'd a priſoner by the Guard, yet within ſhe ſeem'd to have all manner of liberty given her. The Captain having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf, they did their meſſage to <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> and then enquiring after <hi>Amenia:</hi> they told her I had commanded them to bring me a certain and true account in what condition they were in. <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> after having ſtood mute a pretty while. Return to your Maſter (ſaid ſhe) and tell him in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51633:42"/> you find me: I am a priſoner, but it is to preſerve me from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of the ſouldiers, who elſe would not have any reſpect to my ſex, nor my birth; Tell him that he may viſit me ſafely and without fear, and that I deſire to ſee him to communicate ſomething to him of importancie; as for <hi>Amenia</hi> proceeded ſhe <hi>Atropos</hi> ſome few dayes ſince hath cut the thred of her life, and when he comes I may give him a fuller narration of it.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as I had heard theſe words I gave a ſudden cry, and (not hearing what elſe they ſaid) life had almoſt forſaken me in that mortal apprehenſton of <hi>Amenia</hi>'s death; And is <hi>Amenia</hi> dead then? (cryed I after I was come to my ſelf) and is <hi>Amenia</hi> dead; and doth <hi>Euripedes</hi> live? In this agonie I would have pull'd off the plaiſters from my wounds, that my life might have breath'd forth at thoſe chinks, but I was deterr'd that, and all other meanes whereby I might effect my own precipitation by the diligence of thoſe who looked to me. Nevertheleſſe, I gave my ſelf over to thoughts, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions that tormented me, and gave me a hundred deaths in a day, and were more cruell than one death. I neglected the counſel of thoſe that were carefull of my wounds, who recommended ſilence and reſt to me; for, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually I vented forth my grief with thouſands of exclamations, till I had ſo debillitated my ſelf, that I was not able to ſpeak more, and for reſt I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not my eyes to cloſe themſelves for three nights together after this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal newes, which made the meſſengers thereof repent that ever they had ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yed me; They all repreſented to me that death would inevitably follow if I perſiſted in my violences, and I that muſt periſh unleſſe I gave my ſelf to reſt. I replied, that I deſired nothing leſſe than life, and that to accelerate my death I uſed all the meanes they had left me, and which they were not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of: they dreſſed my wounds as it were by force and much againſt my will, and they were all fain to beg with teares in their eyes, and upon their knees, for me to take ſuſtenance, and not ſo wilfully to perſiſt in my death; they exhibited their love by an unanimous imploration, which made me uſe violence againſt my own inclinations to ſatisfie ſome part of their love and care by taking what they deſired, and by letting them endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my life, only to avoid thoſe implorations which they daily continued: but I would not mittigate the leaſt part of that grief and dolor that I endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red through the apprehenſions of her death, and they were ſo violent that without doubt I had continued much longer, had I not been miraoulouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. One and twenty dayes had now paſt over ſine the laſt battel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I received thoſe wounds, which (with the augmented grief for <hi>Amenia</hi>'s death) had kept me in bed, when ſome of thoſe few men who accompanied me, going out, aſwell for proviſion as to hear, whether there was no hope of recovering their own out of the <hi>Romans</hi> hands, had met with a man, who made an earneſt enquiry after me, he was diſguiſed which made them not think it ſafe to diſcover me, but, being preſt very much by him, and ſeeing he was but a ſingle man, they at laſt brought him to me. They firſt certified me how they had met him, and his deſire to ſpeak with me, though I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable almoſt to take notice of any thing, yet at laſt I bid them bring him in.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as he was entred my Tent, I knew him to be a young man that belonged to <hi>Amenia,</hi> the ſight of him renewed my grief, Ah (cri'd I out with vehemency) art thou come to confirm that which I already know, but too much for my repoſe, or to reproach me in that I retain a Life after the loſſe of <hi>Amenia</hi>'s, ſpeak, for thou canſt not augment the dolor I have conceiv'd by the confirmation of that which makes me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd of my ſelf in that I live ſo long after the firſt knowledge of it. The young man, not knowing my meaning ſhewed he was ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51633:43"/> by his ſilence, but at laſt ſeeing I expected his anſwer, he replyed. <hi>Sir,</hi> I believe you are not ignorant that I have the honour to belong to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> 'tis in her behalfe I have ſought you to give you this Letter. Whilſt he was a pulling it out, I replyed haſtily: why, where is <hi>Amenia?</hi> what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of her? is ſhe alive or no? prethy tell me all that thou knoweſt, and hide nothing from me. <hi>Sir</hi> (replyed the Lad) I know nothing of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, nor what is become of her, but two dayes after we had heard that you had loſt the laſt Victory againſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> we underſtood thoſe that came from <hi>Lancia</hi> were almoſt at our walls: thoſe ſouldiers that were in the City being terrified at their approach abandon'd us to their fury, and with abundance of the Inhabitants left the City; I was in it when I ſaw the great confuſion and tumult of thoſe that fled, which made me haſte to the Pallace, and going up the ſtaires into the outward Hall I met <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthe</hi> deſcending in very great haſte, Aſſoon as ſhe had eſpied me, I never met thee (ſaid ſhe) more gladly than I do now, nor in a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou mightſt expreſſe thy fidelity to <hi>Amenia,</hi> ſo much as now thou mayſt, I was going to ſeek one, whom I might entruſt with what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and I know none more capable than thy ſelf, of doing it with thy wonted fidelity. After I had given her all the aſſurance I could of it, and of the Joy I conceiv'd that I ſhould do any ſervice acceptable to <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> ſhe proceeded thus: You are not to take thought what will become of us in this approaching danger, only you are deſired by me, to depart the City immediately with this Letter, (which ſhe put into my hand) and enquire after <hi>Euripedes,</hi> if he be alive deliver it to him, if he be dead bring it back again to me, but uſe all your diligence to find him out, and with all the ſpeed you can, for in doing it you will do <hi>Amenia</hi> the greateſt piece of ſervice you ever did her in all your life, and if the Gods preſerve her ſhe will requite you for it. She had hardly ended theſe words, when three or four men in very great haſte came to her ſaying, <hi>they all waited for her,</hi> and conducting her away in great haſt, left me alone upon the ſtaires. I immediately preparing for my Journey departed the City within an hour, and for all the diligence I have us'd I could never hear the leaſt word whether you were living or no till this day, (being almoſt out of hope after ſo long ſearch) I met with thoſe who have conducted me hither to deliver this Letter with which I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted.</p>
               <p>I heard him with hope that he might give me ſome knowledge that ſhe liv'd, but ſeeing what he had ſaid neither confirm'd nor contradicted it, I remained in my former perplexity, but (ſaid I as I received the Letter from him) doſt not thou know that <hi>Amenia</hi> is dead? <hi>Sir</hi> (ſaid he) I know nothing of it, and I have related faithfully all that I know, it may be the Letter may give you more light. I then fell to opening it but with mortal apprehenſions of what it might contain, I dreaded the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of that which had ſo debilitated me, but uncloſing it I found it was <hi>Amenia</hi>'s hand, which gave me as much Joy I could poſſibly receive in that condition. My teares for ſome time hindred me the reading of it, through thoſe apprehenſions that continually aſſaulted me, but at laſt with ſome hope I began, and with a world of conſolation ended the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of words to this effect.</p>

               <p>Before I had finiſh'd the reading of it all that were preſent ſaw by the joy I exhibited in my eyes, with what content I receiv'd it, and reading it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver divers times I continued a great while in this conſolation, framing to my ſelf a happineſs which the very next thought dejected; for reflecting upon that which I had heard concerning her death, it not only mitigated, but abſolutely took away all the joy I had conceived. After I had deſired the man that brought me that Letter not to depart from me, before he ſaw me recovered, and that the company were withdrawn, leaving me to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of my thoughts, I uttered many different exclamations both in the ſenſe of my joy and grief. Sometimes reading that letter with exceſſe of joy, I ran into thoſe pleaſing cogitations, that made me to forget my grief, and reflecting on every word I could not ſee her affection without a world of content, being that (as I then thought) that would make me the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt man living, being that which I had deſired with ſo much paſſion, and for which I had expos'd my life to ſo much danger. But theſe joyes did but augment a grief that came violently upon me at the leaſt reflection of her death, for conſidering that this letter was wrote before I receiv'd that fatal news, and that I could find nothing that might contradict it, nor could gain no knowledge of the man that brought it, you may conſider what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies I was in, and with what grief I was agitated by theſe cogitations. I thought that <hi>Mandone</hi> might ſacrifice her to his reſentments, or that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51633:44"/> her ſelf, rather than yield to him againſt her inclinations, might precipitate her ſelf to death, theſe thoughts with thoſe that the nearneſs of my happineſs, and the aſſurance of her affection, had rais'd, augmented my dolor, in that I loſt a happineſſe at the point of receiving it. Before (ſaid I to my ſelf) her ſeverity, her duty, and that law which ſhe had impos'd upon me, made me languiſh in pain, and were the only motives of my grief, but now her duty is taken away, her ſeverity is turned into mildneſs by her inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that Law is aboliſht by her affection, yet I languiſh in paine and more powerful motives to grief are repreſented to me, motives that ſubvert both my joy and my hope, to joy in knowing her affection, when ſhe is incapable to render it to me is a folly, to hope ſhe ſhould revive, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon, no, no, her death is too ſure, and all my joy and my hope is turn'd to grief and deſpaire. In ſuch reſpirations I languiſhed for ſome moments, when different motions aroſe. It may be (ſaid I again to my ſelf) it may be that <hi>Amenia</hi> lives, and expects thee, and reproaches thee for thy tardineſs, in that thou expoſeſt her ſo long to the violent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of <hi>Mandone,</hi> and giveſt her cauſe to think that thou ſlighteſt her, and that may make her fill'd with indignation to give her ſelf up to <hi>Mandone,</hi> more to diſpight thee than pleaſe her ſelf; haſten therefore and do not fruſtrate her expectation, in neglecting to help her by a vain opinion of her death. Sure this was my good <hi>Genius</hi> that inſuſurrated theſe ſuggeſtions, and though they were not able quite to aboliſh thoſe fatal apprehenſions I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd of her death, yet they made me reſolve to feſtinate the cure of my wounds, by yielding to whatſomever might conduce thereto, that I might go to <hi>Clotuthe</hi> to underſtand the deſtiny of <hi>Amenia,</hi> and ſo either to redeem her if living, or to follow her if dead.</p>
               <p>The deſire I had to be cur'd made me yield to all that was propos'd to me for the curation, and in ſpace of a week I left my bed, and before another was fully finiſht I departed that place fully cured. But leaſt ſuſpition ſhould be raiſed in the breaſts of our enemies, by our number we divided our ſelves and took ſeveral wayes to <hi>Aſturica,</hi> I kept only the young man that brought me <hi>Amenia</hi>'s Letter. From him I underſtood the brave reſiſtance <hi>Gurgulinis</hi> had made at <hi>Lancia</hi> againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> which had ſo incens'd the ſouldiers, that their Captain could hardly gain them from turning that Citie into aſhes, and by the ruines to have made it a perpetual monument of their fury. We were come within ſight of that ſtately City <hi>Asturica</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any adventure, when the gods intending to make me the inſtrument of their juſtice, ſent thither the chief of the <hi>Brigaecins,</hi> who was the author of our deſtruction, and had betrayed us to <hi>Cariſius,</hi> by giving notice of our deſignes upon their Camps. The beaver of his cask was up ſo that the young man knew him, and diſcovering to me who he was, I reſolved to ſacrifice him to the Ghoſt of <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> and to execute that juſtice upon him which was due to traitors. Riding up to him I diſcovered my ſelf, and ſoon let him know what he was to expect from me; his conſcience accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him of the fact he anſwered not, but being valiant he refuſed not the combate. It was ſoon debated, for my anger againſt the traitor ſoon aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented my ſtrength, ſo that I left him dead upon the place, with almoſt twenty wounds, I receiv'd not any ſo conſiderable, as to make me to repair to the Chirurgions, but ſtopping their bleeding with ſuch things as I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes carried about me, <hi>I</hi> entred <hi>Asturica</hi> almoſt in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>My impatiency gave me no liberty to repoſe my ſelf that night without ſeeing <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> and I long'd to know a deſting, which would either prove fatal or joyful to me. I therefore went to that tower wherein I underſtood ſhe was, and the guard knowing my deſire to ſpeak with their Captain, ſent an
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51633:44"/> Officer to underſtand his pleaſure. It was not long before he came to me, and underſtanding my deſire to ſee <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> and that it was by her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that I came thither, after having uſed thoſe civilities the <hi>Romans</hi> were ever prepared with, he deſired my ſtay for a moment whilſt he went in and gave <hi>Clotuthe</hi> notice of it. <hi>Clotuthe</hi> was kept ſo ſecret, that none in the City, no nor his own ſouldiers knew of her being there, for if the one had known it, they would have endeavoured her releaſment, being extream af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate to the family of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>libilis,</hi> and if the others had known it, the reſpect of the Captain could not have detain'd them from endeavouring her deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, being very much incens'd againſt the whole ſtock of <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> which made him keep a guard more then ordinary with pretences ſpecious enough to blinde the eyes of others. At laſt the Captain of the guard returned, and told me that <hi>Clotuthe</hi> was ſomewhat indiſpos'd and in bed, and therefore deſired to be excuſed from any viſit that night, but deſiring that I would lodge in that place, and in the morning ſhe would not fail to viſit me betimes. After ſome other words between us of complement and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>I</hi> entred without the leaſt ſuſpicion of any thing, only troubled at the procraſtination of my life or death. I was led into a very ſmall court, and through that up a paire of ſtairs, into a chamber very well furniſht, I knew the place very well, for this tower which had ſeveral roomes in it, was ſomewhat remote from the Palace, and was alwayes the retirng place of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilis,</hi> being the ſtrongeſt and moſt ſolitary of all the Palace. After the Captain had left me with the young man, whoſe name was <hi>Laſcaris,</hi> I was ſoon viſited by that woman belonging to <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> who made the ſame excuſes to me as the Captain had done, but longing to hear of <hi>Amenia,</hi> I deſired her very earneſtly to let me know what was become of her, but ſhe anſwered me her Miſtris would ſatisfie me her ſelf, and that ſhe was charg'd to the contrary, ſhe told me that when the <hi>Romans</hi> entred the Citie being abandoned, the Captains had much ado to keep them from raſing the foundations of it, and how that Captaine coming firſt to the palace, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Clotuthe</hi> involved in thoſe common miſeries that had befallen the whole <hi>Aſtures,</hi> out of a meer ſenſe of pity preſerved her from the rage and fury of the ſouldiers, and taking that part of the palace for his own quarter, he conveighed her thither very privately, and had thitherto us'd her with the ſame reſpect he owed to his mother. This was all I could learn of her, and as ſoon as ſhe departed I went to bed, and <hi>Laſcaris</hi> into another in the ſame room. I will not tell you how I paſt over that night, but you may be ſure it was with trouble enough, and wholly imployed in thinking on <hi>Amenia,</hi> with fear, hope, and joy; having wearied my ſelf with theſe thoughts I fell into a ſlumber in the morning, which detain'd me longer in bed then I intended. I was juſt about to riſe when <hi>Clotuthe</hi> knock'd at my door, I bid <hi>Laſcaris</hi> unlock it to ſee who it might be, and having obeyed; <hi>Clotu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the</hi> entred with that woman, the Captain and three or foure ſouldiers. I wondred to ſee ſo many enter my chamber, but ſeeing their intentions, <hi>I</hi> had roſe our of my bed had not the preſence of <hi>Clotuthe</hi> ſtopt me to have prevented them, for the Captain and thoſe ſouldiers ſeiſed upon my arms, and both our ſwords; Ah Madam (ſaid <hi>I</hi> looking upon <hi>Clotuthe</hi>) what u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is this? have you betray'd me? <hi>Laſcaris</hi> would have run to have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them, but putting the points of their ſwords to his breaſt, they had put a period to his life if he had wag'd. Aſſoon as they had got the poſſeſſion of them they departed the room, leaving only <hi>Clotuthe</hi> and her woman with her. When they were gone without conſidering <hi>Laſcaris</hi> ſhe ran to me with open armes, and quite forgeting her wonted modeſty, ſhe claſp'd them about my neck, and letting her face fall upon mine. <hi>Euripedes</hi> (ſaid ſhe) that buckler wherewith you were wont to oppoſe my Love, and to defend
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51633:45"/> your ſelf, is now taken away, for now <hi>I</hi> have no duty that ſhould binde me, from giving you the teſtimonies of my good will, neither can you refuſe them if you have any regard to the life of <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> and you muſt now ſeek new excuſes if you continue in your diſaffection, but <hi>I</hi> am ſure you cannot finde any wherein virtue may intereſt her ſelf againſt me. <hi>I</hi> account all my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows as nothing, and all my miſeries incompetable to that joy <hi>I</hi> receive now in imbracing my <hi>Euripedes;</hi> and <hi>I</hi> muſt make him ſee the greatneſſe of my affection by paſſing thoſe bounds preſcribed to our ſex, but <hi>I</hi> cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of this when I have more manifeſtly teſtified my weakneſſe. It was the amazedneſs I was in at this action, and the trouble that had ſeiſed me for being deprived of my armes and made a priſoner, that made me ſuffer her in her action and words, but by that time I had recollected my ſelf, bluſhing more than ſhe did, and putting her off with my hands. Madam (ſaid I) you are not ſo abſolved (by the death of <hi>Lilibilis</hi>) of your duty, but that you ought ſtill to have in veneration the memory of ſuch a husband and not contrary to the rules of modeſty and decency to embrace one whom you have confeſt to have lov'd in his life time. I had hoped thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles wherewith you have been afflicted, had taken away theſe thoughts, and had reduced you to a more perfect knowledge of your condition. But you have given me cauſe of a very great and juſt reſentment againſt you, in taking away thoſe armes wherewith I have endeavoured to maintaine your lives and liberties, and by delivering me into the hands of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and not conſidering how often I have expoſed my life to danger for your ſakes. Is this then the reward <hi>Clotuthe</hi> I ought to expect? and is this the requital I ſhall receive for my paines? and is this the ſure teſtimonies of your Love? Ah <hi>Lilibilis</hi> doſt not thou behold this action of thy wife from the lower ſhades with regret, and doſt thou not ſay. Ah <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> haſt thou ſo ſoon forgot me as to deſire the imbraces of another, and art thou ſo ingrate to my friend (he who hath endeavoured with indefatigable paines to withſtand our evil fortune, and whoſe good will to us hath made partaker in our miſeries) as to render him a captive to our enemies? and deprive him of a liberty which may yet be for your good? I had gone on further had ſhe not replied very briskly. It is but juſtice that <hi>Euripedes</hi> ſhould be my captive ſo long as I am his, and though I cannot captivate that part of his which he hath of mine, yet will I give to my ſelf this ſatisfaction, that I will impriſon his body in lue of thoſe bonds wherein he holds my ſoul. But ile aſſure you, you are not priſoner to your enemies except you account me ſo. I hope (replied I) I ſhall never count you my enemy, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take this as the effect of your friendſhip. It is nothing elſe (ſaid ſhe again) for it was impoſſible for me to part with you having you in my poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and could I believe you would ſtay with me willingly, I would never conſtraine you, it is nothing elſe but fear of loſing you, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving my ſelf of that happineſſe of ſeeing you, that makes me act thus altogether againſt my inclinations. I have not been free from all thoſe fears love uſes to ſuggeſt ſince your departure, and having recovered that ſickneſs which my grief had caus'd, there yet remained ſome ſuggeſtions of hope, and now to ſatisfie my ſelf in part be not offended if I detain you by conſtraint. I would not have you think ſo ill of me but that my grief was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for <hi>Lilibilis</hi> his death, and that (though ſo much againſt the intereſts of my love) I could wiſh him alive again, but ſeeing that is impoſſible it would be a folly to precipitate my ſelf to death by thinking to loſe you alſo, and whilſt my duty oppos'd, I had ſo much power over my ſelf as to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the incitements of my love, and deny my ſelf the taking of theſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, but now my love is ſo powerful that it baniſhes all thoſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of modeſty and decency.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:51633:45"/>
               <p> She was once again going to embrace me, when caſting her eyes on the other ſide of the bed ſhe eſpied <hi>Laſcaris,</hi> whom her paſſion before had not given her leaſure to take notice of, though ſhe had ſeen him; ſhe knew him to belong to <hi>Amenia,</hi> which made her face ſeem all of a fire, being troubled that ſhe had made any other beſides my ſelf witneſſe to her weakneſſe, withdrawing from the ſide of the bed with an action that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her trouble, how came this man to accompanie you, ſaid ſhe, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her demand as well as I could, and told her he had left the Citie in that confuſion when the <hi>Romans</hi> entred it, and found me out to give me notice thereof, hoping I might relieve it in that neceſſitie, and that ſince that time he had waited on me, being I had told him I would bring him to <hi>Amenia</hi> to whom he belongs. I know he doth very well (anſwered <hi>Clotuthe</hi>) and I ſee the gods are reſolved to make my foes acquainted with my follies. I cannot believe Madam (returned I) that any who have the honour to wait on your daughter in Law can be your foes. She was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamlie ſhamed at this ſurpriſal that ſhe would not ſpeak a word more, but with a face as red as fire, with anger and ſhame, ſhe caſt her eyes towards me, and turning her back, was haſtning out of the room. I was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to let her return without ſome more knowledge of <hi>Amenia,</hi> and I had not the patience to ſtay for another viſit; this deſire made me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call her by theſe words: Madam you ſent me word you had ſomething of importance to let me know, I hope this is not that you promiſed, beſides you promiſed that <hi>I</hi> ſhould know what hath hapned ſince my departure, and what is become of <hi>Amenia,</hi> I pray do not defer it till another time. That which I have to tell you, (ſaid ſhe) I will not declare before any witneſſe, and I have ſpook already too much for my ſhame. If you pleaſe to procure leave for <hi>Laſcaris</hi> to go out (ſaid I) he ſhall be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to what you have to ſay. She was very willing to utter her mind, and ſhe ſaw that <hi>I</hi> was unwilling ſhe ſhould depart, and I believe ſhe did not miſtake the cauſe, but after a little pauſe, ſhe bid her woman to go forth into another room with <hi>Laſcaris,</hi> and being left alone with me ſhe returned and ſat down upon the ſide of my bed.</p>
               <p>After ſhe had ſat ſilent for ſome time with her eyes very intentive upon me. <hi>I</hi> will no longer diſſemble with you <hi>Euripedes</hi> (ſaid ſhe) nor hold you in ſuſpence of that which you deſire to hear; <hi>Amenia</hi> is not dead, but <hi>I</hi> know you had rather wiſh her ſo, then where ſhe is. <hi>I</hi> am not ignorant of your affection to <hi>Amenia,</hi> and that ſhe was the only obſtacle that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the fruition <hi>I</hi> deſired, no <hi>Euripedes</hi> it was not the conſideration of <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> nor of vertue, ſo much as that of your love. Yes it was the beauty of <hi>Amenia</hi> that had prepoſſes'd you, and that rendred mine ſo deſpicable in your ſight, and that hindred me of all <hi>I</hi> could deſire of <hi>Euripedes.</hi> So long as hope was remaining you might perſue your love, as you thought to your advantage, but now there is no hope of enjoying her who lives in the arms of <hi>Mandone,</hi> you will not exhibit ſo great a follie as to perſiſt in it ſtill, and to love her who never lov'd you, for if ſhe did complie with you in any thing, it was in conſideration of her own intereſts, and in hope of that benefit ſhe might reap by your labours, and that you may know it was nothing elſe, when ſhe ſaw you were no longer able to withſtand the deſtiny of her Countrey, ſhe abandoned you fighting for her, and ran into the arms of <hi>Mandone,</hi> without any regard to your love and ſervices, and that ſhe might not have any thing to do with you, ſee here the letter you ſent her, which ſhe left with me that ſhe might not have any thing near her that might cauſe her to remember you.</p>
               <p>You may imagin by the relation of the Love <hi>I</hi> bore <hi>Amenia</hi> how much this diſcourſe perplex'd me, and for all the reſolution <hi>I</hi> had taken not to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51633:46"/> exhibit my Love if ſhe had certified me of her death, <hi>I</hi> was not able in this ſudden knowledge of her unworthineſſe to withſtand the aſſaults of my paſſion, nor to with-hold the giving of a perfect knowledge to <hi>Clotuthe</hi> by my actions, of the great love <hi>I</hi> bore <hi>Amenia;</hi> all the blood in my face, and all other parts was run to the heart, to ſtrengthen it, which had need of all its forces at that time to with-hold it from falling under that burden this fatal news had charg'd it with, it had ſo ſuppreſt the paſſages of my ſpeech that <hi>I</hi> could not expreſs it but by actions. At laſt <hi>I</hi> confirm'd my ſelf in the opinion, by knowing the letter that <hi>I</hi> ſent <hi>Amenia</hi> to be the ſame <hi>Clotuthe</hi> preſented me; <hi>I</hi> was ſo afflicted that I was not able to bring forth one word, but ſinking down upon my pillow, <hi>I</hi> gave <hi>Clotuthe</hi> time enough to proſecute her diſcourſe, and <hi>I</hi> remember (though with much ado) ſhe ſaid thus. Ah fortunate <hi>Amenia!</hi> to be ſo highly lov'd by <hi>Euripedes:</hi> But ah unworthy and baſe <hi>Amenia,</hi> to require it ſo baſely and perſideouſly! But <hi>Euripedes</hi> (ſaid ſhe, taking me by the hand) ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not to have any thoughts beſtowed on her, acquit her to <hi>Mandone,</hi> and let her enjoy him whom ſhe hath acquired, through her perſideouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to you. If her beauty were more eſteemed by you than mine, yet my love far exceeds hers, and all other mortals. <hi>Euripedes</hi> be not ſo cruel to <hi>Clotuthe</hi> as to let her ſo often ſue to you, let the baſeneſſe of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi> oblitterate that affection you bore her, und let it ſuſcitate a diſdain worthy your ſelf, and alſo let the ſidelity and paſſion of <hi>Clotuthe</hi> acquier that which was unworthyly beſtowed on another. There can now be no hope of enjoying her, ſhe now is embraced by <hi>Mandone</hi> whom ſhe deſired: therefore let not your thoughts be buſied about her, nor trouble your ſelf with her that is unworthy of them. Its true <hi>Euripedes,</hi> I ſent you word that ſhe was dead, but that was for fear if you had known the truth that you might have gone to have revenged your ſelf on <hi>Mandone,</hi> and ſo I might have loſt that content <hi>I</hi> receive by yout ſight. Endeavour therefore to ſettle your thoughts, and to enjoy and accept of that which hitherto you have refuſed, and which ſhall not be leſs through any conſideration that you were forc'd to it, and if that you are not altogether blind, you cannot but ſee the great love <hi>I</hi> bear you, and if there be but the leaſt ſpark of generoſity in you, you cannot be altogether ſo ingrate as to deny me. And though <hi>I</hi> keep you with me by conſtraint, you need not fear that you ſhall receive any hurt under my protection, nor that you ſhall be denyed any thing but your liberty. She uttered much more which I cannot remember, nor have <hi>I</hi> rendred this but brokenly, for my thoughts were occupied with the news ſhe had told me, that <hi>I</hi> was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of remembring or hearing what ſhe ſaid. At laſt ſeeing her ſtop, I replyed with that little ſtrength I had left me. Madam, ſince that you have had ſo much knowledge of my love to <hi>Amenia,</hi> and ſince <hi>I</hi> believe <hi>I</hi> have confirmed it by my actions in receiving this news you have told me, I will not diſavow it, or go about to deny that <hi>I</hi> have lov'd <hi>Amenia:</hi> But <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that that was the reaſon and not the conſideration I had of vertue and of <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> that made me not to comply with you. Its true, <hi>I</hi> have lov'd <hi>Amenia;</hi> and if I have committed a fault, ſhe hath puniſht me enough by this action, but <hi>I</hi> ſhall not reproach her, ſince truly I was unworthie of her. Madam (perſu'd <hi>I</hi> with another tone) you ſay nothing ſhall be denyed me but my libertie, I will not ask that ſince it will be denied me, but let me entreat this favour of you, that I may be left alone for ſome time that I may digeſt this novity, which hath made me altogether inſociable. I ſhall deny you nothing (replyed ſhe) that may conduce to your repoſe, and you ſhall find me ready to cede to any thing but the loſing of you, for my life is of leſſe eſteem to me than your company, but I know how to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51633:46"/> deny my ſelf to pleaſure you. After I had given her many thanks for the favour ſhe did me in complying with my humour, and that ſhe had again aſſured me that I ſhould receive no diſcommodity in the place, but what my own thoughts brought me, by her incroaching upon my liberty ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and <hi>Laſcaris</hi> returned to me again.</p>
               <p>When I had receiv'd by the abſence of <hi>Clotuthe</hi> ſome libertie of afflicting my ſelf with the thoughts of that cruel news, <hi>I</hi> receiv'd from them all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and anxities a mortal man was capable of, and whole heaps of thoſe cruel cogitations precipitating themſelves upon me, in ſuch an indigeſted manner, overwhelmed my ſenſes, and took away all power of methodizing my trouble. In this manner <hi>I</hi> lay almoſt void of ſence and reaſon for a long time, <hi>Laſcaris</hi> having endeavoured with many perſwaſions, which I was not capable to underſtand, to have brought me to my ſelf, but at laſt having ſpent ſome hours in this great dolor without ſpeaking or moving, <hi>I</hi> fell into thoſe pathetick complaints that <hi>I</hi> even made <hi>Laſcaris</hi> accompany me with his tears, I am not able to remember what I uttered, but ſure I am that thoſe Querimonies occupied me all that day, without giving reſt to my mind or food to my bodie. Sometimes after I had even tyred my ſelf with complaining, I expreſſed my ſelf by ſuſpirations, and deliberating with my ſelf, I would cry out, Ah, who ſhould <hi>I</hi> blame? who ſhould <hi>I</hi> accuſe? ſhall <hi>I</hi> ſay it is <hi>Amenia?</hi> or ſhall I put it upon my evil fortune? or ſhall <hi>I</hi> not attribute it to the Gods, who by this ſeem to conſpire my over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, by overthrowing me with the faddeſt miſeries? But what ſhall <hi>I</hi> accuſe <hi>Amenia?</hi> ſhall the love that <hi>I</hi> bore her reſign the precedency to anger? what though ſhe hath forſaken me? can <hi>I</hi> give to my ſelf ſo much power as to forſake her? ſhe hath made me no promiſes that ſhe hath broke, nor gave me any aſſurances but what my conjecture made ſo, if ſhe hath obeyed the will of her father can <hi>I</hi> blame her? or ſhould <hi>I</hi> not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay it upon my unworthineſs, or the ſmalneſſe of my deſerts? But yet <hi>Amenia,</hi> tell me, would not you have blam'd me if I had forſaken your intereſts if I had deſerted you, and had not oppoſed the violence of your enemies with the hazard of my life? methinks you cannot but blame your ſelf <hi>Amenia,</hi> if you conſider it with any Juſtice, you might have given me notice of it, and at leaſt endeavoured in ſo ſmall a matter to have ſatisfied my devoires. But you may ſay, you ought to prefer your own fortune before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of another. Yes <hi>Amenia,</hi> if you could have done it without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, if in him whom you injure were not one who had ſacrificed all to your intereſts, and wholly neglecting his own, had intirely ſought yours, and if that by the action you were not made the ungratefulleſt of women, in complying and ſeeming to have ſo great a care both of my life and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only for your own ends, a thing unworthy one of your quality, and at the concluſion by your deſertion to give me worſe torments than death could afford. No <hi>Amenia</hi> would you be juſt? you ſhould be conſtant. Would you be accounted true? you muſt not diſſemble? Are you pollitick? exhibit it by juſt and righteous wayes, and draw not upon you the anger of the Gods by making thoſe miſerable, who knew not what miſery was till they came to ſerve you. In theſe and ſuch like diſcourſes with my ſelf <hi>I</hi> ſought to pacifie the perturbation of my mind, but all was in vain, for did <hi>I</hi> begin to be angry with her <hi>I</hi> blamed my ſelf, did <hi>I</hi> reflect on my own trouble and miſery, <hi>I</hi> cryed out on <hi>Amenia,</hi> was <hi>I</hi> thinking on my impriſonment <hi>I</hi> ſpent reproaches againſt <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> and for all <hi>I</hi> increpated the gods, with all the words that could be uttered from the ſenſe of my ſoul-tormenting grief.</p>
               <p>In this manner I ſpent the day not riſing out of my bed, nor giving my ſelf any repoſe, nor taking of any ſuſtenance, which <hi>I</hi> was reſolved to continue, had not the implorations of <hi>Laſcaris,</hi> and his obſtinancy in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51633:47"/> following my example in my jejunations, made me to ſuſtain my ſelf with what was brought me. I could ſee no want of any thing but my liberty in their accommodations, for I was obſerved with more reſpect than uſually was given to priſoner, but I was not capable to conſider either their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſitie or pedantry, being wholly merged in my own miſeries. After I had obſerv'd the good nature of <hi>Laſcaris</hi> I repreſented to him that which he could not be ignorant of by my actions, but I gave him a brief knowledge of my love with the favours <hi>Amenia</hi> had done me, and the intentions of <hi>Clotuthe.</hi> After this knowledge he vowed himſelf to my intereſts, and with many proteſtations ſought to gain my good opinion of his fidelity; after that time I made him the depoſitorie of whatſoever I thought moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; and I was not deceiv'd in his love and fidelitie.</p>
               <p>After he had intuited my laſt letter from <hi>Amenia,</hi> being paſſion had not depriv'd him of that reaſon, mine had made me incapable of, he began to repreſent the little need I had to increpate <hi>Amenia,</hi> and making me read over her letter again, ſo illuminated my mind, that I began to ſee with a leſs troubled judgement, that it was not ſo as <hi>Clotuthe</hi> had repreſented it, and blaming my own paſſion for my former ablepſie, I began to perceive it to be a contrived plot from the malice of <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> and the more I began to examine it, the more clear and apparent it exhibited it ſelf to me, I could then view with greater contentment the earneſtneſs that <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> uſed for my feſtination, and to conſider the care ſhe had to ſend me word, with the liberty ſhe gave me to recover her, which ſhe would never have wrote, had not ſhe been forc'd. And <hi>Laſcaris</hi> repreſenting to me with what haſt <hi>Melanthe</hi> was had away when ſhe gave him the letter, and with what earneſtneſs ſhe expreſſed her deſire to have the letter given me, confirmed me in my opinion, and began to eſtabliſh that hope which through <hi>Clotuthes</hi> means had been dejected.</p>
               <p>But after I had given ſome time to that newcome joy which <hi>I</hi> felt through thoſe apprehenſions, and eſtabliſht my hopes that it was not impoſſible but that ſhe yet might be mine ſince ſhe was alive, I was encompaſt with a new perplexity, in remembring I was reſtrain'd: and ſo was incapable to help her, which gave me new cauſe of grief, that at laſt brought me to this reſult: To endeavour my releaſe, and to go reſcue <hi>Amenia</hi> out of the arms of <hi>Mandone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe reſolutions employed all my thoughts to gain my releaſment, but all the intentions I could make uſe of prov'd in vain, and in vain did I make uſe of all the devices, my paſſion was able to ſuggeſt, and in ſpight of all my endeavours, I was forc'd to perhyminate, mancipated to the will of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting <hi>Clotuthe</hi> in that place; tormented by my delay, and quotidianly plagued by the perſeverance of her affection ſo much againſt my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I muſt leave you here to imagin the diſtreſs I was in, for I am no wayes able to expreſs it, though <hi>I</hi> ſhould tell you I did things inexcuſable in any other that were not implete with the like paſſion. For ſometimes <hi>I</hi> fell into revilings, and ſo furiouſly with what weak inſtruments were left in my power, I aſſaulted the walls, windows, and all obſtacles to my liberty, that even <hi>Laſcaris</hi> durſt not preſent himſelf before me, fearing I had been utterly abandoned by ſenſe and reaſon, ſeeing me do ſuch <hi>Athamantick</hi> actions. When my ſtrength was overcome by my labor, <hi>I</hi> gave way to thoſe words that were agreeable to my rabid humour, and in them <hi>I</hi> vented what want of ſtrength had deter'd in my actions. Theſe viſits of <hi>Clotuthe</hi> were aſſiduous, and never without exagerating her paſſion, and at laſt ſhe became ſo preſſing, that ſhe made me go beyond civilitie, when <hi>I</hi> ſaw ſhe paſt the bounds of modeſtie. At firſt <hi>I</hi> endured the viſits of <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuthe,</hi> and heard her prolix amorous diſcourſes with ſome patience, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51633:47"/> permitted the proſecution of her paſſion out of a hope to gain my releaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but when I ſaw all means fail, and that ſhe would not releaſe me without <hi>I</hi> would ſwear not to deſert her, the which <hi>I</hi> would never conſent to, and at laſt reſolving not to be beholden to her for my freedome, <hi>I</hi> told her that prizons ſhould never alter the reſolutions <hi>I</hi> had taken never to love her. Then it was <hi>I</hi> fell into thoſe ravings and diſtractions, ſeeing all means fail me, and all my devices prove in vain, and then it was that <hi>I</hi> begun to be uncivil to <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> and ſought by all eſſayes to irritate her for the taking away of my life, and oftentimes when ſhe came to ſee me <hi>I</hi> would ſhut my eyes at her ſight, and ſtop my ears from her words. In this miſerable condition, <hi>I</hi> ſpent almoſt four moneths, and then being paſt hope, and made equanimous whether I would or no, I effected my libertie thus.</p>
               <p>The Captain who had order to make <hi>Aſturica</hi> his <hi>Hybernacle,</hi> facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated <hi>Clotuthe</hi>'s deſign of keeping me priſoner with all the power he could, being drawn thereto by the ſpecious pretences ſhe had fain'd: but never told the true cauſe of my detainment, and fearing leſt her ſubtil devices ſhould be manifeſted through our communication, ſhe never would permit the Captain to viſit me but in her company, and that but very ſeldome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his preſence impoſ'd a coercive power upon her words and actions, and made thoſe viſits even tedious to her ſelf. But <hi>I</hi> who had not loſt all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſitie with my patience, conſidered the intereſts of <hi>Clotuthe</hi> for the ſake of <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> and therefore would not diſcover any thing to the Captain of her love, though it was to my own prejudice, nor detain'd thoſe civilities which were due to her in his preſence. But the Captain being of too penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Judgement, and love beginning to intereſt him in our actions, made him perceive ſomething of inclination from <hi>Clotuthe</hi> to me, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the reſtraint ſhe impos'd upon her ſelf in his preſence, and beſides perceiving I know not what in me worthy of his good will, he had a great deſire to have more communication with me than was permitted him by the good will of <hi>Clotuthe:</hi> But Love who by degres had ſeized the Capital of this Captains breaſt, of a Conqueror had rendred him a Captive, and made him ſubject to the commands of his priſoner. It was <hi>pity</hi> made him at firſt preſerve her, but now Love made him more ſtrictly keep her, for <hi>Clotuthe</hi> had amiable features, beſides a very winning behaviour and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that gave attractions not to be reſiſted but by ſuch who were as much prepoſſeſt as my ſelf. For fear of diſpleaſing her was the only cauſe that he forbore his own inclinations of viſiting me, but at laſt perceiving by her frequent viſitations, that ſhe had inclinations for me, Love making him grow jealous, he convey'd himſelf into a Cloſet adjoyning to my Chamber, and where he might hear what paſt between us very eaſily, for <hi>Clotuthe</hi> ſurprizing me in the midſt of thoſe implorations, which the cruel abſence of <hi>Amenia,</hi> and my own reſtraint had caus'd, the obſtacle of my happineſs, and cauſe of thoſe perpetual torments I felt, coming in the midſt of my reſentments, cauſ'd me more eager and louder than ordinary to ſpend ſome part of my reproaches againſt her, which ſhe ſeeking to appeaſe by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of her Love and paſſion, laid open all to the hidden Captain, and by the words that we mutually uttered there was nothing hidden to him of either of our conditions, either of her love or my averſion, and though he was ſorry to find the one, yet he was glad to hear the other, and for that cauſe did not extinguiſh that good will he bore me.</p>
               <p>The Captain having found enough by our laſt viſits, he did not ſo ſtrictly tye himſelf to her obedience, but that he broke it for his own good, but deſirous not to exhibit his diſobedience, he viſited me contrary to her knowledge with great ſecreſie, and unknown to any that were about her.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51633:48"/> I was no leſs joyful to ſee him there alone than himſelf, and then I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſum'd my hopes of releaſment by his means. After our firſt civilities and ſome mutual diſcourſes of indifferent matters, I asked him concerning <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> and whether he could tell what was become of her. He told me that when they entred <hi>Aſturica</hi> they underſtood of her departure, but whither he was ignorant, upon this diſcourſe he broke his minde to me, I will not relate his words or manner, which was graceful and rhetorical, but the ſubſtance in brief was this. He exbited to me how he had ſaved <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> and how ſince he had preſerv'd her, he had been tyed to her by the conſtraining power of Love, which had made him ſo incivil to me. What I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before concerning him I then learnt it from his own mouth, and he gave me the knowledge of his love, and how he had exhibited it to <hi>Clotu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi> and how coldly ſhe had receiv'd it, with the ſuſpition he entertained concerning her inclinations to me, though ſhe had pretended I was her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had come purpoſely to have ſacrificed my life among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> for her intereſts, and that ſhe had uſed that means to impriſon me, leaſt I ſhould have effected it, by the killing of ſome of the chief of them, and that I was grown ſo furious at that detainment, that I had no conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of her, and that ſhe had appeaſed me by making promiſe not to let any know who I was, and therefore ſhe communicated it to him as a great ſecret, and thereby engaged him not to diſcover it to me, leſt I ſhould tax her with breach of promiſe, and exhiting to him how great averſeneſs I bore to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> deſired him not to viſit me, becauſe his preſence would ſtir up great perturbation in my minde, but at his requeſt ſhe permitted it in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, with deſiring him not to make known by either word or action what he knew concerning me, and that he ſhould look upon thoſe civilities I paid her, as only to blinde his eyes, being that I was aſſured ſhe would not let him know what I was, and this (he told me) being alſo ſhortly after ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his love to her requeſts, was that which deterr'd him from thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits he deſired to render me. I could not but ſmile when I heard how ſubtilly <hi>Clotuthe</hi> had blinded his eyes, and I would not contradict nor aver what he ſaid, which ſeeing he proceeded, and ſmilingly told me, though I would not take notice of <hi>Clotuthes</hi> ſubtilty, yet he would make me confeſs that I was not the brother of <hi>Clotuthe.</hi> He then told me after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he had diſcovered it, and what he heard, and how much knowledge he had in both our affaires, and laſtly craving pardon for the crime his love and jealouſie had made him commit in hearkening after the ſecrets of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he vowed his friendſhip to me eternally, and to expiate that fault he would render me all that lay in his power to do, or what I would deſire of him. I could not but embrace him at that offer, and ſeeing that I could no longer hide the love of <hi>Clotuthe</hi> from him, ſeeing it had been manifeſted by her own ſpeeches that he had heard, and conſidering how generouſly he had dealt with me in confeſſing all to me, both of his own love and the love of <hi>Clotuthe</hi> to me, not conſidering me as a rival, or as an obſtacle to his deſires, he had vowed himſelf my friend, and proffered me his ſervice to the utmoſt, I ſay I could not without ingratitude any longer hide my ſelf from, or reject a friendſhip ſo nobly offer'd me, and that might be ſo conducing to my happineſs.</p>
               <p>Therefore that I might render him the ſureſt teſtimonies of my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. I gave him a true account both of my life and fortune, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe actions I had done againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> did not diminiſh one jot of the affection that he bore me, being more firmly grounded, and knowing that love had made me onely their enemy. After I had let him underſtand the progreſs of my Love, it was needleſſe to tell him that I deſired my liberty, but that he proffered though he found ſome difficulty to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51633:48"/> effect it, leaſt <hi>Clotuthes</hi> anger ſhould light upon him. Fearing therefore to draw the indignation of <hi>Clotuthe</hi> by too manifeſt a liberation, he found out a means for my eſcape, that none might know he was conſcious to it, not <hi>Clotu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the</hi> attribute it to his neglect. He prepared a kind of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oxicum</hi> mingled with ſuch corroding ſtuffe, that being layed to the croſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bars of the window in a ſhort time fretted them aſſunder, and gave a libertie of eſcaping with long and ſtrong ropes which he alſo holp us to. That night being come where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were to effect our liberty, my <hi>Philoneus</hi> viſiting me, rendred me words which ſeem'd to ſlow from a hearty affection, and after many em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces and vowes of eternal amitie, he left me to take that liberty which himſelf had procur'd. <hi>Latona</hi>'s daughter did not exhibit at that time her ſplendid face on our hemiſphere, which facilitated our eſcape, but that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity would have ſear'd one from a precipitating dangerous enough, that was not incited by love and deſire of liberty. After I had faſtned the rope to a ſtrong beam, I ſlid down to the ground with great facilitie, and after I had ſafely reſted my ſelf on the earth at the bottom of the Tower, <hi>Laſcaris</hi> followed me with the like ſecuritie. Then it was that I found ſome joy after my accuſtomed grief, that I had my libertie to reſcue <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> or to depoſe my life for her ſake. I ſoon left that deteſted place, and at the corner of the Tower ſound two horſes which the Captain had order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be left there, with ſwords, and armes, for my ſelf, after <hi>I</hi> had accouterd my ſelf with thoſe armes, we went to the back-gate of the Palace which was guarded with a ſlender guard, the chief of them being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Captaines intentions, procured my paſſage without any noiſe or diſturbance. I left that Citie with as much joy and ſpeed, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore I had approached it, when the Sun-ſhine of <hi>Amenia</hi>'s preſence ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it in its primeſt glory, but now the darkneſs wherein I left it, ſeem'd to me to proceed from <hi>Amenia</hi>'s abſence. By the next morning I was got far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from the ſearch of thoſe whom I believe the Captain ſent after me to pleaſe <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> but I alſo believe he facilitated my eſcape by ſending them different waies from that which he knew I took, for I neither ſaw nor heard of any that gave ſtop to my ſlight, which <hi>I</hi> accelerated with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al journeys, till <hi>I</hi> entred <hi>Juliobriga,</hi> which then harboured my dear <hi>Amenia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt news that I heard was the preparation for the marriage between <hi>Amenia</hi> and <hi>Mandone,</hi> I cannot tell which was greateſt, either the anger that was enkindled in my breaſt againſt <hi>Mandone,</hi> or the joy I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the marriage was not yet conſummated, but conſidering how much difficultie there yet remain'd to acquire her; I fed my imaginations with a hundred ſorts of inventions. I had neither men nor arms to accompliſh my deſignes by force, neither could I gain them, the whole countries being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſubdued, and ſubjugated to the <hi>Romans.</hi> The father of <hi>Mandone</hi> was ſlaine in thoſe wars, and himſelf was taken priſoner, but the <hi>Romans</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly releaſed him, and gave him a domination under them, over <hi>Juliobriga,</hi> and thoſe lands which adjoyned to it, but the City was then full of <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers, and they were making great preparations for his wedding, being glad ſo fierce a Prince liv'd ſo quietly under their yoak. The next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my arrival, having conſulted it to be the beſt way, I ſent <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I waited with a longing expectation till the afternoon for the return of <hi>Laſcaris,</hi> and at laſt I eſpied him coming with <hi>Melanthe,</hi> I found an extraordinary joy at her ſight, in that I hoped thoſe doubts which had ſo long perplex'd me by the means of <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> would now find a period by the means of <hi>Melanthe.</hi> When ſhe was entred
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51633:49"/> my chamber I entertained her with open armes, but not daring to name <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> I ſtood trembling between hers; out of a fear I had ſhe ſhould have forſaken me for <hi>Mandone. Melanthe</hi> imagining my fear by the knowledge <hi>Laſcaris</hi> had given her, put me beſide it with theſe words. <hi>Laſcaris</hi> hath given good ſatisfaction to <hi>Amenia</hi> for your long ſtay and ſlackneſs in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying her, you need not fear ſo reaſonable a Princeſſe can retain any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for your diſobedience when there was an impoſſiblity of obeying. She hath not forgot your ſervices, nor your love ſo ſoon, as to reſolve to marry <hi>Mandone;</hi> nor yet hath their remembrance left her ſo little courage, as not firſt to have conjugated her ſelf to death, although ſhe never gave you any aſſurance that ſhe was yours, yet by her actions ſhe would have teſtified it, that ſhe could not have been ingrateful to you, nor have been the leſs yours for his having her in his power.

Theſe words were <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſia</hi> and <hi>Nectar</hi> to my ſoul, and they gave me a real taſte of the goodneſs of <hi>Amenia,</hi> I could not but reply with the ſubmiſſiv'ſt words Love and humility were capable to infuſe. I extol'd <hi>Amenia's</hi> goodneſs, and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited my own unworthineſs; and expreſſed my ſelf ſo pathetically that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthe</hi> could not but ſee there was not the leaſt abatement in my love, but that the tyde of my affection was increaſed by the ſtoppings and dams of afflictions and determents. After our firſt ſpeeches I caus'd her to ſit down, and <hi>Laſcaris</hi> being conſcious to my Love, was not now to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, therefore <hi>Melanthe</hi> at my requeſt gave me this account of <hi>Amenia</hi> after I had left her.</p>
               <p>When that your warlike Troops had left <hi>Aſturica,</hi> and that that Citie by your abſence ſeem'd deſolate, <hi>Amenia</hi> was aſſaulted with a ſudden trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which with a ſilent vaticination, foretold her enſuing diſaſters, and made her foreſee a miſery which was to come upon her, though ſhe was ignorant which way it ſhould hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51633:49"/> room, we found out the thief purloyning the Letter, which was laid as a bait for her, being thus taken in this, ſhe confeſſed her former fact, and how it was through her means that <hi>Mandone</hi> came to fight with you, and that ſince that time ſhe had diſcovered to <hi>Clotuthe</hi> that you were in love with <hi>Amenia,</hi> and that ſhe bore you no little affection, and that <hi>Clotuhe</hi> by her inſinuations had gain'd her to ſteal that Letter, which ſhe had told her <hi>Amenia</hi> had receiv'd from you, and that in doing it ſhe had receiv'd a reward, that had made her covet to do the like by that which we had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her in. <hi>Amenia</hi>'s indignation was raiſed at this confeſſion, but ſhe took no other puniſhment on her that deſerved greater, but baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her her ſervice for ever, but <hi>Clotuthe</hi> entertained her for her infidelity. <hi>Amenia</hi> was cruelly afflicted, that ſhe knew ſo much of her affaires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe lay open to all her machinations, having none now to guard her from her devices, for ſhe knew <hi>Clotuthe</hi> both ſpiteful and ſubtil enough to work her miſchief, and ſhe had ſome little ſuſpition that ſhe was her corrival, though you never intimated ſo much. <hi>Clotuthe</hi> and <hi>Amenia</hi> after this knowledge met not in a long time after, being ſegregated to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and by reaſon of <hi>Clotuthes</hi> unwillingneſſe to meet <hi>Amenia,</hi> but at laſt they met one another, where <hi>Amenia</hi> ſtuck not to tell her of her ill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but with a great deal of modeſty and civility.

But ſtay <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> do not you think the death of <hi>Lilibilis</hi> diſengages you to <hi>Mandone,</hi> he hath promiſed you to him, and though he lives not to perform it, you ought this way to exhibit your love to him by performing what heen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and do you account me your enemy and your foe, by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to finde out your affection to <hi>Euripedes,</hi> and by trying to convince you of your errour, when <hi>Mandone</hi> may claim you for his wife by right by the itterated promiſe and engagements of your father, which ought, not to die with him, and when you cannot marry <hi>Euripedes</hi> without great diſhonour? flatter your ſelf no longer, for if you will not be <hi>Mandone</hi>'s by Love and fair means, he hath yet power enough to force you, notwithſtanding the power of <hi>Euripedes,</hi> who is a ſtranger, and not ſo worthy as <hi>Mandone,</hi> a redoubted <hi>Iberian.</hi>

               <p>Anger had ſuſcitated a freſh crimſon in the cheeks of <hi>Amenia,</hi> and ſhe had anſwered theſe ſpeeches had <hi>Clotuthe</hi> ſtaid to have heard her, but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing her diſcourſe ſhe would not ſtay for a reply, but left <hi>Amenia</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſturb'd at her words. <hi>Amenia</hi> ſaw not <hi>Clotuthe</hi> after that, but reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to her chamber, conſidered her diſaſters with much weeping. In this ſhe continued till a ſurcharge came, which I thought would have been the greateſt, it was the news of your laſt overthrow, ſhe heard the valour of the General recounted, but ſhe could not learn whether he was ſlaine or no, or whether he ſurvived that cruel encounter. Truly this conſideration more then the loſſe of her Countrey made her finde
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51633:50"/> new ſprings of teares, which ſhe thought her former grief had wholly exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Flood-gates of her eyes were hardly wide enough to let forth thoſe torrents which impituouſly guſhed out thereat. The next newes ſhe heard did not ſo much trouble her; being fore-ſeaſoned with a greater, as otherwiſe it might have done, and it was the approach of our enemies towards <hi>Aſturica,</hi> having taken <hi>Lancia,</hi> and our own men who were left to guard it abandoned us to their fury. This diſaſter was hardly conſidered when a greater befell us by the meanes of <hi>Clotuthe,</hi> who had moſt maliciouſly ſent for <hi>Mandone,</hi> and given him notice both of the Letter, and of your Love to <hi>Amenia.</hi> I was ſitting that morning that the <hi>Romans</hi> entred <hi>Aſturica</hi> with <hi>Amenia</hi> in great heavineſs conſidering our diſaſters, and what would become of us in that confuſion, and in a very ſad poſture were we when <hi>Mandone</hi> entred the Chamber with two or three more. This ſudden and unexpected coming of <hi>Mandone</hi>'s ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd <hi>Amenia</hi> that ſhe was not able to riſe from the ſeat where ſhe ſat, which gave him liberty to uſe all thoſe civilities which he was accuſtomed to pay her. <hi>Madam</hi> (ſaid he) Although the gods are reſolved to ſubjugate theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys to the <hi>Romans</hi> for an addition to their glory, yet have they had ſo great a regard to your perſon, that they have ſent me for your preſervation, and for that end only have they preſerv'd my life, that I might preſerve yours in this extremity. Our fortunes are alike <hi>Madam,</hi> and I hope our affections are not unequal, ſince by the will and command of both our Parents we were accounted individual: if you have loſt your father, the gods alſo have taken away mine; if you have loſt your Countrey I have alſo loſt mine; if you have been abandoned by your friends, and are in danger to be ruined by your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, I have run the ſame fortune, and my life is ſolely given me for your preſervation. I am come therefore in this very exigent to carry you forth of the jawes of theſe cruel <hi>Romans;</hi> make not now my endeavours fruitleſſe, nor ſacrifice both our lives to our foes by your delay, for our ſafety conſiſts in a ſpeedy departure, the <hi>Romans</hi> are even at the walls and there is ſcarce time for theſe words. <hi>Amenia</hi> by this time had recollected her ſelf, and riſing at that time from her feat; I am not <hi>Sir,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) leſſe daunted then I thought ſhe had been) ſo afraid of death but that I can embrace it joyfully, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taſted too much miſery to deſire life: I had rather be buried in the ruines of my Country, than to flye it in its deepeſt miſery, and offer this life to the hands of thoſe, that have ſacrificed the lives of my Country-men, ſlain my friends, and taken away the life of my father; to be ſlain by their ſwords than leave this place. I am very ſenſible of your care of me, and render you many thanks for your paines, but let me deſire you to leave me to my diſaſters, and not engage your ſelf in them, nor look that you are obliged to it for me, more then any other woman, ſince I am about to leave all the world, that all the world may leave their pretenſions to me. I deſire not, nor care for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therefore leave me to receive death the chief object of my deſires. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> (replyed <hi>Mandone</hi> ſuddenly ſomewhat ſtartled at her reſolutions) the conſideration of your honour ought to feſtinate your abſceſſion, for you cannot continue here but that muſt be contaminated; they will ſooner aim at that then your life, there is no way left to ſave it but by avoiding that, (by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den flight) which their fury will make them perpetrate. Think not (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amenia</hi>) but that nature hath given us that liberty of dying when we pleaſe, and ſhe hath not been ſo nigardly of giving us meanes to effect it, as to uſe other inſtruments but our own. You need not fear that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhall contaminate my honour, my death ſhall prevent them; Beſides, I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf but that it is more diſhonour to flye my Country then to die for, and with my Country. It is impoſſible for me to ſurvive all theſe diſaſters, it is better then for me to die quietly than with a languiſhing life to be daily dying in miſery. <hi>Mandone,</hi> ſeeing his perſwaſions in vain, and being a very
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51633:50"/> paſſionate man, and foreangred by the relation of <hi>Clotuthe</hi> concerning your Letter, he could no longer hold from exhibiting it. What is your chiefeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters (ſaid he, anger ſparkling through his eyes) is it in out-living <hi>Euripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des?</hi> I doubt not but you would change your Reſolutions if he were the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant, no, you ſhall not die for <hi>Euripedes,</hi> but live for <hi>Mandone.</hi> What, will you force me then? (cryed out <hi>Amenia</hi>) ſeeing he led her by the arm forcably towards the door. It is not force <hi>Madam</hi> (ſaid he) when it is for your own ſafety, but if it be, and that I am irreverent, I hope you will not blame me for it one day, when that you have more reaſon then now you have, the other of his men did the like by me. When <hi>Amenia</hi> ſeeing they would have her away by force, had recourſe to her teares, and deſired <hi>Mandone</hi> to give her ſo much time as to take her chiefeſt Jewels with her, and to give her ſome ſmall liberty in her Cloſet. He could not deny her this, having made her ſwear that ſhe would not do her ſelf any hurt, they gave me liberty like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to accompany her, when I had alſo ſworn not to let her do any injurie to her ſelf. She craved this liberty only to write you that Letter you laſt receiv'd, and in that perturbation ſhe gave you the greateſt proofs of her affection you could have required. When ſhe had wrote it and ſeal'd, I gained ſo much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as to pack up the chiefeſt Jewels that ſhe had which were exceeding rich, and after that I got from them as they were leading <hi>Amenia</hi> out of the Pallace at a Poſtern, and in deſcending the Pallace ſtaires I happily met <hi>Laſcaris,</hi> I had no ſooner given him that Letter but thoſe who belonged to <hi>Mandone</hi> came to ſeek me, for <hi>Amenia</hi> would not enter the Charriot without me, this made them uſe thoſe words to me which <hi>Laſcaris</hi> did not underſtand. After I was come to <hi>Amenia</hi> we entred into the Charriot in great haſte, for that we heard the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſo near that we doubted our eſcape: we could not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine the reaſon why <hi>Clotuthe</hi> would not leave <hi>Aſturica,</hi> but now we no longer doubt it, ſince by the relation of <hi>Laſcaris</hi> we underſtand it was but to make a prey of you to her ſelf.</p>

                  </gap>ng expected. <hi>Amenia</hi> at firſt anſwered him as if ſhe had loſt no part of her authoritie, and denied him the taking of thoſe Liberties, he profered to take, with as much courage as if ſhe were ſtill in her priſtine power in <hi>Aſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica;</hi> But this proud Prince, being not able to bear it, began with more impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſitie to aſſail her, and was about to prepare for a conſtrained marriage, had not her teares, which had more influence upon him, then that manner of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, given him a <hi>Remora.</hi> He was content at laſt to grant her that enſuing Winter to conſummate her lacrymations for her father, for ſhe continually urg'd, that ſhe could not marry ſo ſoon after the death of <hi>Lilibilis,</hi> and ſo great loſſes ſhe had ſuſtain'd in her Country, till time had partly wore away thoſe ſorrowes, and had made her more capable for the pleaſures of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but <hi>Mandone</hi> had made her promiſe then not to withſtand his deſires, which ſhe did out of hope that before this time we ſhould have heard of you. <hi>Mandone</hi> after this gave <hi>Amenia</hi> all the libertie ſhe could deſire, and us'd her with abundance of reſpect, ſeeking all manner of divertiſements, to make her leave that ſorrow which eclipſed the gracious beames of her countenance. But I am not able to expreſſe the leaſt part of the dolor ſhe endured when all her hopes were aboliſhed by your abſence; ſhe ſaw the winter quite paſs away, and you not come to give her the libertie ſhe expected, ſhe knew not who to vituperate, nor who to blame for your abſence; ſometime ſhe chid <hi>Laſcaris</hi> for his negligence, ſometimes ſhe thought him ſlain, or that he could not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51633:51"/> find you. Sometimes, ſhe reproached you for your delay, and with wofull complaints would incuſe your affection, and with dolor enough ſhe thought you had forgot her. But moſt of her teares, laments, and reflections were for your death, and that ſhe condol'd with ſo much affliction, that it would have pittied the moſt obdurate. The time was now at laſt come that ſhe was by her promiſe to render her ſelf into the armes of <hi>Mandone,</hi> ſhe was reſolved to do it, but at that inſtant alſo to have rendred her ſelf breathleſſe, and in performing her promiſe, performed alſo what ſhe thought was due to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of her Tragedie; but the Gods at laſt when all her hopes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were at an end hath doubled her Joy by your arrival, and by knowing the cauſe of your ſo long ſtay, which hath given her ſufficient proofs of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe compleated my joy, for by the conſtancie of <hi>Amenia</hi> I judg'd of the puritie of her affection: and I was quite obeaecated if I did not ſee mine was accepted; It yet remained, to make me perpetually happie by her preſence, and that I might arrive at the ſummit of my felicitie, by gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her out of the power of <hi>Mandone,</hi> which was to be expedited with a feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated diligence, for all cunctation was now dangerous. By the advice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>Melanthe</hi> I went that night to ſee <hi>Amenia,</hi> and by the help of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ladder got over into a Garden adjacent to the Pallace, and into the which <hi>Amenia</hi>'s Chamber-door opened. Neceſſity and Love were both my friends, and they both pleaded for that reception ſo contrarie to her humour, ſhe could not abſtain from ſhedding ſome teares at my firſt inviſagement, nor I at the ſight of hers: our tongues were obſerated for a time, whilſt our eies exhibited in moiſt Characters, both the ſorrow our ſeparation had caus'd each to other, and the joy our re-meeting brought. Silence at laſt gave way to abundance of words that I emitted, in demonſtrating the anxietie and dolor I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone for thoſe perplexities that had befallen her and her Country; and for my cruel detainment in that I was made uncapable to help her. I told her, how that I valued not my life longer than I might retain it ſolely for her ſerivce, and for that end had I overcome thoſe miſeries, which elſe, might have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred me among the extinct.</p>
               <p>I have ſpun the thred of my Narration longer than I intended, I ſhall not therefore extend it by relating our Diſcourſes at that time, but indeed her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence gave me not more joy, than her words, which were conduceable to my happineſs, in that ſhe gave me an aſſurance of that which before I could never draw from her. She acknowledg'd that ſhe did but what was juſt, yet had not that exigent enforc'd her to it, ſhe had been for a longer time ingrate to my merits, in denying me the knowledge of that Soveraigntie Love had given me over her ſoul, her modeſtie and ſeveritie ſtill proving obſtacles to that Confeſſion. At laſt ſhe conſented (ſince the bonds of dutie were unloos'd and thoſe of Love more firmly faſtned by afflictions) to leave that perplexed Country, and return with me into mine, ſhe then gave me charge to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite her abſceſſion, and remitted her ſelf into my hands. I never undertook a charge with more joy, nor more deſired then this: I doubted not but that the Gods would favour my enterprize, ſince they had been ſo propitious to my laſt deſignes. That ſmall ſpark of animoſitie which I then poſſeſt, would not have had me bore away <hi>Amenia</hi> ſo ſecretly, and without the death of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor, could I have gained the conſent of gentle <hi>Amenia,</hi> but ſhe abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbad thoſe thoughts of doing injurie to <hi>Mandone,</hi> ſince only Love had made him my Enemie, and in her abſceſſion I ſhould puniſh him more than by death. I yielded to all her deſires, and gave her as abſolute a power over me as ſhe could have wiſh't. That night was one of the happieſt I ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, though I was not permitred any other liberties than ſometimes to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh ſome kiſſes from thoſe lillyed hands, which notwithſtanding at that time
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51633:51"/> were ſufficient to give me more content than the gift of Empires. I am not able to exhibite, nor none able to imagine the content and pleaſure I received in her companie, after ſo long abſence, but thoſe who have experienced the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies of the <hi>Idalian</hi> fire, and whoſe chaſt Loves have found opportunitie mutually to communicate, in the midſt of difficulties and hazards. You muſt help me out of this pleaſurable content with your thoughts, for I am as little able to give you a perfect knowledge of it, as to deſcribe the ſplendor of the Sun. As our affections work adequate, ſo were our joy and content, which made us think <hi>Father-time</hi> had added more plumes to his Wing, to acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate his ſpeed, for my thought I had newly begun but to taſte the ſweets of her Companie, when <hi>Laſcaris</hi> giveing me notice of the approach of the early godeſſe, we were fain to disjoyn leaſt danger ſhould proſecute my bold attempt. She prohibited my returning thither any more, till I came to take her with me, leaſt I might incurre that danger which might put a period to out lives and Loves together; Having ſealed my Adues with many ſuaviations on her hands I returned by the ſame help undiſcried to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where I had time enough to conſider the meanes how to carry <hi>Amema</hi> from thoſe Towers.</p>
               <p>I entertained many projects, and I found them not over difficult, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her will correſponded with my deſires. But not daring to commit this ſecret to any one, I was conſtrain'd to ſend <hi>Laſcaris</hi> to <hi>Taracone,</hi> to prepare a veſſel ready for our tranſportation, againſt we came. It was a great deal nearer cut to the <hi>Cantrabrick</hi> ocean, but then I conſidered that we ran an aſſured danger of being met with at the <hi>Herculean</hi> frete, and although this was more troubleſome and incommodious for <hi>Amenia,</hi> yet it was more ſecure, and cut off that great compaſſe we muſt have taken by ſea. After <hi>Laſcaris</hi> was gone, <hi>I</hi> was viſited almoſt every day by <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthe,</hi> for <hi>Mandone</hi> being as it were aſſured of <hi>Amenia,</hi> the marriage day being now very near and not finding her ſo obſtinate as ſhe had formerly been, which ſhe did to facilitate her eſcape, he did not keep her as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, but gave her all the liberty ſhe could have deſired, for he did not perceive any inclination to eſcape from him if ſhe could. There lackt but four dayes for <hi>Mandone</hi> (as he thought) to have had the full poſſeſſion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> when I having provided, two eaſie Palfrays for <hi>Amenia</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthe,</hi> thus effected my deſign. <hi>Melanthe</hi> had given notice to <hi>Amenia,</hi> and had packt up her richeſt Jewels, preparing every thing againſt the night, and to facilitate our eſcape, ſhe had gotten of the Gardner the key of a back gate at the further end of the garden, this ſhe had done divers other times, and returned it him again to divert his ſuſpition, but this night ſhe kept it on purpoſe to ſave <hi>Amenia</hi> the labour of getting over the wall. At that gate ſhe appointed me to appear in the dead time of the night, which I failed not to effect, at the hour appointed. I did not ſtay there long before <hi>Amenia</hi> and <hi>Melanthe</hi> appeared, of all the others that attended her, ſhe had not confidence enough in any beſides <hi>Melanthe</hi> to communicate this ſecret, ſo that ſhe left them all ignorant of her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So ſoon as I ſaw her I fell upon my knees, and in the humbleſt terms Love was able to infuſe; I expreſſed my acknowledgement of all thoſe obligations wherewith ſhe had bound me. She would not permit me long in thoſe agnizements, but raiſing me up, put me in mind of the danger we ſhould incur, if through our cunctation we ſhould make our deſign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual. After this remembrance without further delay I ſeated them on their horſes, and with what ſpeed we could we haſtened our flight. The heaven favouring us, ſpread over his face a dark vail, that we might travel with the more ſecurity, Nevertheleſs fair <hi>Cynthia</hi> ſometimes peep'd through the chinks of thoſe dark clouds, being proud to illuminate the ſteps of a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51633:52"/> beauty, which in that obſcurity ſeem'd to out-ſhine hers. We made ſo good uſe of our time, that before <hi>Aurora</hi> had uſhered in the Sun, we were got further from <hi>Juliobriga</hi> than our purſuers could imagin. <hi>I</hi> know the want of <hi>Amenia</hi> put <hi>Mandone</hi> the next day into an unparrallel'd confuſion, and I make no doubt but that he ſent throughout the Countrey to retake us, but our diligence, ſpeed and care made all his ſcrutiny in vain, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to avoid all the great towns, and to take our lodgings in ſmall villages, and ſometimes in ſome lone cottage, making our accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion give way to our ſecurity. Beſides we performed moſt of this journey by night, and reſted our ſelves in the day time, ſo that we made our ſelves inſcrutable. <hi>Amenia</hi> underwent this toylſome voyage with great alacrity, but not without ſome fear, leſt ſhe ſhould fall again into the hands of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</hi> But not to hold you any longer with this voyage, love and fear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether made <hi>Amenia</hi> overcome the tediouſneſs and incommodiouſneſs of it, and we ſafely arriv'd at <hi>Tarracone,</hi> where we found that <hi>Laſcaris</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a veſſel, and the wind alſo ſitting right for our purpoſe we ſtayed there but two dayes before we imbarqued, and committing our ſelves to the mercy of <hi>Neptune,</hi> we left the <hi>Iberian</hi> coaſt, and ſurrowed over the <hi>Tyrrhenian</hi> ſea with proſperous winds, and full blown ſails; all thing ſeeming to conſpire for my happineſs, made me almoſt loſe my ſelf in the gulf of pleaſure and content.</p>
               <p>The ſea accommodated us with its calmneſs, and the wind with gentle furthering gales, and <hi>Amenia</hi> beginning to ſhake off her fear, gave me teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of her affection, by a thouſand endearments: we had time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the progreſſe of our fortune, and to conſider how tragically that vituperated power had acted for our feli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lity. Thus the ſea and the wind favouring us we glided over thoſe deeps, but the next day being upon the deck of the ſhip, we eſpied a veſſel to make toward us, with great ſpeed, when ſhe was come within perfect knowledge, the Marines knew her to be a Pirate. This news made <hi>Amenia</hi> reaſſume her fear, and made her ſhake off that content ſhe had but now received. But whilſt that ſhe ſtrove with the aſſaults of thoſe firſt apprehenſions, I had arm'd my ſelf for her defence, and incouraging the Mariners, I incited them to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous oppoſition. The Pirates made us quickly ſee their intentions, for forceing their prow againſt ours, they put us into ſome danger, ours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weaker veſſel, but aſſoon as they had joyned, I cauſed iron graples to be made uſe of, for the joyning of the ſhips, and then being ſtimulated with the danger of loſeing <hi>Amenia,</hi> and putting a period to the content I had newly taſted of, I leaped into their ſhip, and there ſurpaſſed all the common actions of my life, by the blowes and wounds that I then gave thoſe wretches. I made them ſee that a Lover was able to do more than an ordinaty man, having ſuch ſpecial incitements as fighting in ſight, and for the life of his Miſtriſs. The <hi>Praedonians</hi> not accuſtomed to be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to have their ſhip entred, were ſomewhat aſtoniſhed, eſpecially when they ſaw that in my furie I here decollated one, there debrachiated another, opened the breaſt of a third, diſſected the leg of a fourth, and to all that came within my reach gave either mortal, or very dangerous wounds. But at laſt the Pirats ſeeing only my ſelf to make that havock, took heart and oppoſed me on all ſides, where at laſt I muſt have periſhed with their numbers, if the Mariners of my ſhip had not diſſipated them; with the help of thoſe at laſt I overcame them, and thoſe that remained, yielded themſelves. But before we could taſt the ſweets of this victory, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could reenter the ſhip where <hi>Amenia</hi> was, we were fain to prepare for a more formidable encounter, for we beheld the Admiral of theſe Pirats being a great ſhip, to ſail towards us with great expedition. We had
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51633:52"/> not time to conſider our danger, before we were ſet upon, and that <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machie</hi> was very conſiderable for the happy encounter of <hi>Lonoxia,</hi> the generous Captain of thoſe valiant Pirats. I ſhall remit to him the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, that he may thereby be ingaged to give you the relation of his life. It prov'd happy for us that <hi>Lonoxia</hi> was the Leader, or elſe we had inevitably periſhed in that ſtorm. Of an enemy he became our friend; and from ſeeking our deſtruction, ſought our preſervation, and conveighed us ſafe to the <hi>Iſſick</hi> gulf.</p>
               <p>It was the happieſt occurrent of all my life, (replyed <hi>Lonoxia</hi>) and fortune never did me a pleaſure till then; and all the Prizes that ever I gain'd, were not comparable to that of your friendſhip, for in it I have found more than both the land or the ſea could yield me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euripedes</hi> returning his Complement very civilly, took up his diſcourſe, and proceeded thus: We ſtayed ſome ſmall time in <hi>Nicopolis</hi> to refreſh <hi>Amenia</hi> after her marine voyage, and from thence I went to my own ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, where I was received with abundance of joy by my Uncles, and my friends, but both theirs and mine was very much leſſned by the loſs of <hi>Araterus</hi> whom I had hoped might have been returned before me. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they could no wayes viruperate me when they underſtood how I was conſtrain'd to leave him, and by what accident we were parted. Neither could they reprehend me for my choice, being the beauty of <hi>Amenia</hi> made them confeſs that ſhe was worthy of thoſe difficulties and dangers I had incur'd for her ſake.</p>
               <p>My burning deſires were ſomwhat cool'd by the water of reſpect, and it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This at laſt was effected, and made very celebrious by the great concurſe of people, and meeting of certain Princes, to try the force of their activity. After which <hi>I</hi> freely enjoyed that beauty for which I had ran ſo many hazards of my life, and gain'd with ſo much difficulty; but then caſting away all thoughts of my former troubles, I enjoy'd an unexpreſſible content and pleaſure, in the embraces of my dear <hi>Amenia,</hi> whoſe love equalling mine made both our felicities joyntly unparrallel'd; fruition took not away deſire, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire was increaſed by fruition; pleaſure ſtifled not our love, becauſe our love was not grounded on pleaſure, but that preſerving or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing our ardencies, we liv'd full of content, and full of happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Our own content made us not forgetfull of our faithfull ſervants, <hi>Laſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> having gain'd the good will of <hi>Melanthe</hi> enjoyed her, with a portion of Lands which I gave them, where content alſo found a reſidence among them.

               <p>
                  <hi>Euripedes</hi> here made ſome pauſe, as being unwilling to begin his more unfortunate adventures, but ſeeing they attended him with the like taciturnity, he proceeded thus.</p>
               <p>You may perceive that love hitherto hath not given me any cauſe to be his foe, but now I muſt begin to relate his disfavours and my misfortunes, wherein you may well perceive how for one moment of pleaſure, he gave me years of pain, and unmatched miſery. For your ſake I will not ſtick to undergo ſome pain and trouble, which the remembrance of theſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51633:53"/> paſt events will unavoidably bring, but <hi>I</hi> may well endure ſome ſmall pain in the relation, ſince I have endured ſo great in the ſuffering them. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I cannot tell how to frame my ſelf to leave the ſtage of my content and happineſs, to begin the ſcene of my misfortunes and miſeries, but ſeeing <hi>I</hi> have promiſed it, and am reſolved to perform it, <hi>I</hi> ſhall only deſire your pardon, if <hi>I</hi> give you not ſo large a relation of my following miſeries, as I have of my precedeing fortunes, nevertheleſs although I intend to be conciſe, I will not omit any of the chief evenements.</p>
               <p>Joy and content never found ſo ample a reſidence, in the breaſts of any as in us, for through the mutual harmony of our ſouls we raviſht each other with a continual Symphony. We lived not but by the eyes of each other, and with ſo perfect agreement and Sympathy we were knit, that we had but one Will, one deſire, and one ſoul diſtributed in two bodies, which ſeeking an inſeparable junction, almoſt expir'd at all thoſe places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it found a free egreſſion. We even ſtrove to outvie each other in this dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable exhibition, and love never enkindled more ardent and immaculate fires, than thoſe that encompaſſed our hearts. In fine we injoyed a paradyſical happineſs, and unparrallel'd felicity. Alas! Whilſt I liv'd in this heaven of content, and day of joy, <hi>I</hi> did not think I could ever have felt the hell of miſery, nor have been wrapt in the night of ſorrow; <hi>I</hi> did not conſider that joyes, pleaſures and contentments rode on the wings of time, and that they had no long reſidence in this world, but at laſt I found it true, for this ſhort day had a long night; this moment of pleaſure, years of pain; and this ſhort content was followed with a world of woe. The firſt and moſt grievous diſaſter was the death of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> by a ſudden and ſhort fickneſs, which ere <hi>I</hi> was aware depriv'd me of her, and wrapt her in the leaden ſheets of death. I need not tell you (for I believe you do not doubt) that I endured a cruciation equal to my former Joy? for my love not being any thing abated, it is impoſſible to declare what dolor I endured; and if you had heard the complaints I uttered, and had ſeen the actions <hi>I</hi> did, you would never have believed that I could ever forgotten her memorie to have lov'd another. But then the dolor I felt, and the exceſs of ſorrow I gave my ſelf over to, had brought me to the very brink of the <hi>Stygian</hi> lake, and I was not recovered without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great care of my friends. After I had recuperated my health I ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated her funerals, and ſpent much wealth on a ſtately monument for her memorie, which finiſhed, I betook my ſelf to a melancholy life, having no children (the joy and life of the parents) to delight in, in which ſtate <hi>I</hi> intended to have finiſhed my dayes, but the gods otherwiſe diſpos'd.</p>
               <p>I continued in this ſolitary condition full of dolor, till my mournfull dayes had equaled my joyful ones, and three whole years were now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired ſince the ſad diſſolution of <hi>Amenia,</hi> in all which time I had ſecluded my ſelf ſo ſtrictly, that I knew not what viciſſitudes or changes had happened in the world, being wholly ſequeſtred to my melancholy thoughts.

               <p>To deliver me out of this voluntary exile, my friends uſed all the means they could deviſe, and my Uncles fearing that kind of life would have ſhortned my dayes, by the exuberance of entreaties gain'd me from thence, endeavouring by all manner of inventions to make me ſo get <hi>Amenia,</hi> and to caſt off thoſe melancholy humours which I had acquired ſince her death. There was nothing of outward means wanting, nor no paſtimes or recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, wherein they did not force me to be one, to divert the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs of my thoughts, but ſtill their endeavours fail'd of their expected iſſue, and I ſtill perſever'd in my penſiveneſs.

Some weeks paſſed away, in the which <hi>I</hi> was truly inform'd what ſhe was, and finding her birth noble, and her riches ſutable to her quality, they became inducements to my proſecution.

                  <hi>Cynthia</hi> without giving her notice of my pain. I could find no excuſe to ſtay from performing the Ceremonies at my Uncles obſequies. This put me to much trouble, and at laſt made me reſolve to exhibite my affection to her at my departure. When I came to take my leave of her, I yet trembled to perform it, but at laſt I effected it with all the Rhetorick I was capable of, and with no leſs paſſion than when <hi>I</hi> courted <hi>Amenia.</hi> If my fancy flattering made me judge her features like <hi>Amenia</hi>'s, my judgement made me ſee her conditions were very unlike, and her vertues not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with hers, for having with ſmall patience heard me diſcover my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe anſwered me ſo extream ſcornfully, and deſpiſing my ſervice in ſuch a manner, that it utterly dejected me for the preſent. But renewing my ſpeech with as good order ar that trouble ſhe had put me in, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, I proceeded notwithſtanding very ſubmiſſively to exhibite my affection, till ſhe with very ſcornfull and haughty language put a period to my diſcourſe, and ſcarcely taking any leave, departed from me, leaving me in extream trouble and confuſion. The wind ſitting very contrary, kept us there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a week, much againſt my Uncles mind, but conformable to mine, in that I hoped with my implorations, yet to mollifie the heart of <hi>Cynthia. I</hi> went to viſit her as I uſed to do, but three dayes one after another ſhe denied to ſpeak with me, yet at laſt <hi>I</hi> gain'd the ſpeech of her, but with the ſame ſcorn as the former ſhe anſwer'd my ſuite, which gave me ſo much trouble, that my countenance was well fitted to follow the herſe of my Uncle. We at laſt left <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> and arriving in <hi>Cilicia</hi> we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed our duties to the dead.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Ceremonies were no ſooner finiſhed, but I was preparing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> and although my Uncle ſought by very many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions to deter me, yet my obſtinacy would give place to no reaſon. That poyſon which <hi>I</hi> avidouſly had ſucked in from <hi>Cynthia</hi>'s beauty, had ſo intoxicated me, that <hi>I</hi> hardly was my ſelf till <hi>I</hi> was returned to <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica.</hi> But the wellcome that ſcornful Princeſs gave me was a terrible corroſive to my heart; for to ſhew you how much ſhe diſliked my coming, ſhe would not permit me to ſee her in many dayes. However nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to deter me, I wore out her rigour with my patience. Whilſt <hi>I</hi> remained adoring this beauty, and conſuming my ſelf with the ſcorching flames of deſire, <hi>I</hi> receiv'd many letters out of <hi>Cilicia</hi> of the very great wrongs that were done me in the partition of that eſtate, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quethed to <hi>Epamondas</hi> and my ſelf, and that all would go to ruine unleſs I returned, yet all that could be wrote was not able to attract me from that loadſtone, nor divert my conſtant motion from that <hi>Cynoſure;</hi> I had wholly devoted my ſelf to her ſervice, though I found nothing but ſcorn, ſlighting and reproaches in all her words and actions. But my ſoul like the <hi>Thracian</hi> ſtone, the more it was merged in the water of her diſdain, the more it was inflam'd; and the more oppoſition it found, the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it had to attain. Some moneths were expired, and ſtill my dolor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, my heart was exhibited by my eyes, my paſſion by my face, my grief by all my actions, and ſometimes by my words, yet hard-hearted <hi>Cynthia</hi> harboured not the leaſt ſpark of compaſſion At laſt that fatal hour came wherein I was to be depriv'd of that happineſs (which I had fancied to my ſelf) that I receiv'd in the quotidian inſpection of her faſcinating beauty: for having had ſome more liberty than uſually with her, being preſſed by my ardent deſires, I urged her with the greatneſs of my paſſion, the extremity it had brought me to, how few dayes I had to reſide upon earth unleſs ſhe graciouſly commiſerated my condition.

Being thus rid of my aſſaſins and having viewed their furibund poſtures till I heard the noyſe of other voyces approaching, I thought it not beſt to tempt the Gods, nor neglect that favour of eſcaping, ſince they had done it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly.

In this place I ſetled (having firſt caus'd my ſervant to depart from me, being not willing that he ſhould partake of my ſelf-impoſed miſeries) where I ſpent my time in recounting the accidents of my life, the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of my fortune, and my alternate loves, with condoling my baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtriving to baniſh <hi>Cynthia,</hi> the confines of my memory, but it was impoſſible for me to extinguiſh that fire which conſum'd me in the midſt of thoſe deſerts, in a place where the raies of the bright Chariot-driver ſcarce ever penetrated, ſo much power had love over my ſoul, the cauſe of all my miſeries; for had I never lov'd, I had never been unhappy. In this place I remain'd the term of an whole year, feeding on that which nature without compulſion yielded, and drinking the water of a clear ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulet which ran cloſe by my domicile, with this food not uſual to me, but more eſpecially with the continual grief of my mind I was ſo altered in my countenance that my moſt intimate friends would ſcarce have known me. But to contract my relation, my life being now a burthen to me, and I deſiring nothing more than death ſith neither company nor ſolitude could divert the tortures of my mind, I reſolved to abbreviate my life with my own hands, but in the preſence of <hi>Cynthia.</hi> Leaving my Cottage with this intention I travelled with a world of pain and trouble, being much debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated till I had gain'd the ſea, where <hi>I</hi> embarkt and arriv'd ſafely at <hi>Theſſalonica.</hi>

               <p>I continued in this condition the terme of a whole year, in which time <hi>Agauve,</hi> had been delivered of the noble Prince <hi>Dardanus;</hi> in all that time I wanted nothing but my liberty, being otherwiſe well attended and provided for.

               <p>After I had made my complaints againſt her, for her deceit in cauſing my imprizonment, ſhe excuſed her ſelf, with wondrous blandiloquie, and ſinguler Rhetorick; She told me that ſhe could not be conſcious to the death of him whom the Gods had aſſigned for her Lord, without committing a moſt heineous ſinne knowing my reſolutions and intentions were to deprive him of his life, and that therefore ſhe had ſecur'd me, not for any other cauſe but for the preſervation of the life of her husband, and that now (ſeeing ſhe had been ſo long the wife of <hi>Palemon</hi>) ſhe hoped I would be ruled by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and not to ſeek for her affection any longer, nor go about to revenge my ſelfe of him that had done me no injury, and that ſince the hope of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining her being paſt, ſhe hoped that my affection was alſo vaniſhed and that ſhe came a purpoſe to give me my liberty, but that it muſt be conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to performe one thing which ſhe would deſire of me. To this diſcourſe I replyed; how that my affection had not been ſo lightly grounded as to be beat off by all the injuries ſhe could have inventented to have done me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but death could make me ceaſe from affecting her, yet ſeeing ſhe could not be mine, I would never deſire any thing of her contrary to vertue, and her honour, and ſeeing that ſhe reſtrained me for fear I ſhould injure the life of <hi>Palemon,</hi> I promiſed her that I would not effect any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; not for to gaine my liberty, but to rid her of her fear and to ſhew her how obedient I would be to every thing that ſhe deſired, and that for my liberty I wholly remitted it to her ſelf, being but requiſit that ſhe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded my ſoule ſhould have the diſpoſall alſo of my body: and further that ſhe needed not to doubt but that I would effect any thing that ſhe could deſire of me, but that I would not do it to gaine my liberty, but only for the affection that I bore her. <hi>Agauve</hi> ſhewed her ſelf extreamly joyfull that I had ſo freely promiſed her, however ſhe made me ſware to do that which ſhe would deſire of me, I would firſt have known what it had been, but that ſhe mightily deſired the contrary, ſo that at laſt I conſented to take a blind oath, imagining that the worſt thing ſhe could have commanded, would have been to have baniſht me from her, and that I would not have done any thing againſt her husband, but the propoſull of this ambitious woman was quite another thing, and which both amazed me, and troubled me that I had ſwore to do it.</p>

               <p>I hope now your ſelf will excuſe me for my averſion to a paſsion that made me ſo enormiouſly conſent to ſo wicked an act: I muſt impoſe my whole fault on my paſſion, for it was that which overcame me through her faſcinating words, and not my conſideration of revenge, or liberty. I told you before that I knew by experience that Love hath been able to extinguſh the coles of vertue, and enkindle thoſe of vice; Judge you therefore whether I ſpeak without juſt cauſe againſt that which made me act againſt all Juſtice.</p>

The night before we ſeized on that young Prince, being extreamly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in my thoughts at what I was about to perpetrate; I felt a continual torment till ſleep had freed me from thoſe cogitations. But being in the kingdome of the image of death, me thought I met a man, who with a very frowming countenance thus beſpake me.</p>

               <p>The frowning countenance, and the force wherewith he ſpake, waked me out of my ſleep, but the impreſſion of this viſion remained ſo ſtrongly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me that I reſolved to forego my deſign, though there wanted not ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions that this was but the working of the fancy in my ſleep upon that which continually agitated my thoughts waking; but I could not believe that this was any ordinary dream, for that I ſo plainly ſaw a vaticination of the fortune of this child, which yet hath left ſome hopes that it may not prove in vain, although I live not to ſee it.</p>
               <p>The next day after this <hi>Spectrum,</hi> being together with my fellow-aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, hard by the Pallace-wall, the Nurſe with the young Prince, and ſome few of the ſeminine ſex, came into a very pleaſant green walk under the wall of the Pallace. Thoſe wickedly ſedulous perſons for the Queens intereſts rejoycing at that opportunity, ran preſently to thoſe Ladies, and forcing the infant from the Nurſes arms, made them ſtrain their tender voices, for the invokement both of gods and men, my ſelf accompanying them (though ſecretly) increpated the gods for their propitiouſneſs to their inhumane deſignes: but theſe Butchers having ſeized on the child, who in that tender infancie, ſeem'd to triumph over his fortune, and not to abaſe his courage with the uſual cries of ſuch tenderlings, at ſuch a ſudden ereption from the arms of his Nurſe, but oppoſing his little eyes againſt thoſe Murtherers, he even danted them with an infant-Majeſty; Having (<hi>I</hi> ſay) ſeized on him, they fled with that expedition that their caſe required, my ſelf following them, both for my own ſafety and the childs, whoſe life I was reſolved to ſave, though with the hazard of my own. We ſlackened not our pace till we had entred a very thick wood ſome leagues from <hi>Tomus,</hi> and being almoſt night, they prepared for their bloody perpetration, which ſeeing and obſerving I know not what kind of authority in the childs face, that did as it were command me to its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, it animated me to a prohibition no wayes likeing to thoſe aſſaſins, firſt I tried the art of perſwaſion, endeavouring to evercome their bloody minds by reaſon, to which they oppos'd the oath that they had taken for the execution, and the hope of the reward they were to receive; they made a mock at the viſion, and ſleighted all my entreaties. When I ſaw
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51633:59"/> there was no other way but that I muſt expoſe my own life to danger for the ſafety of the infants, I ſuddenly ſnatched him out of the hands of one of them who was about to have pierc'd his tender belly with his ponyard, and laying him behindme, I drew for his defence. All there immediately drew upon me, making me uſe the utmoſt of my skill and ſtrength for my own ſafety. Notwithſtanding the ods that they had, the juſtneſs of my quarrel cal'd down the aſſiſtance of the gods, who indued me with ſo much ſtrength, that in leſs than the ſpace of an hour <hi>I</hi> laid two breathleſs at my feet, and made the third ſeek his ſafety in his heels. Being now left alone with the child, and night having ſurpriz'd me, troubled for the hunger it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, and the lodging it was like to have in that ſuccourleſs place, I at laſt took it in my arms, not without tears both of joy and grief, the one for that it had eſcap'd the murtherous hands of a ſtep-mothers inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and the other for the miſery it was oppoſed to: but knowing there was no ſuccour in my tears, I travelled all night to have found ſome cottage, that <hi>I</hi> might have given to the child what its tender nature crav'd. But alas! ſo had the gods ordain'd it, and ſo hard was its deſtiny, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſuccour it found either his death, or more miſery, for the day no ſooner appear'd to the renewing of my comfort and hopes, but that I was met with by ſix Thieves, who having given me ſome wounds for withſtanding them, forc'd the infant from me, and left me wholly diſconſolate for my averſe fortune.</p>
               <p>After I had bewailed the hard fortune of that Princely child, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the inconſtancy of my own, I found out a Cottage where I remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome few dayes, till my wounds were heal'd; after which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan my jorney towards <hi>Cilicia,</hi> having no deſire to ſee <hi>Agauve,</hi> my love being turn'd into deteſtation of her bloody humour. As I was returning not far from <hi>Tomus</hi> being entred a ſpacious wood, I heard at ſome diſtance the groans of a perſon drawing near his end; the further I went into the wood, the nearer I ſeem'd to approach it, and at laſt being guided by the noiſe that he made in emitting his ſoul, I came to the place from whence I had heard thoſe groans, where I found a man weltering in his blood, which had been effuſed at many wounds. His face covered with blood and duſt was not to be known, but his ſtrong heart ſtill wreſtled with death, though he had an advantagious entrance at very many wounds. Pity and humanity attracted my ſmall endeavours to his help, though I ſaw an impoſſibility of recovering him, but having wiped the blood from his face I knew him to be the ſame man that had eſcaped my ſword, when I fought for the defence of the young <hi>Palemedon.</hi> I wondered to ſee him ſo pitifully martyred, but it he made me remember that the Juſtice of the Gods, quickly overtakes ſuch aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinous wretches, and payes them the to utmoſt of their merits. After I had made him underſtand who I was, and with my endeavours brought him ſtrength enough to ſpeak, <hi>I</hi> gathered thus much out of his broken Language, beeing interrupted with the continuall paines of death and lack of ſtrength. He told me being returned to <hi>Agauve,</hi> and haveing faithfully related to her what had happned, ſhe was extreamely enraged at me, vowing ſome way or other to be ſeverely revenged, being mightily perplexed that the child had eſcaped, fearing leſt her treachery ſhould come to light, and for that cauſe not dare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to truſt him, inſtead of the reward he lookt for, by her commandement he was ſo ſlaine having been intiſed into that place by her meanes. This was all that Death gave him leave to utter, being totally overcome by him at the concluſion of theſe words. Haveing intomb'd him under a heap of leaves I departed and met with no other evenement worthy the recitall till I came to my habitation, where I found that diſtance of place, nor length of time had yet extirpated my memory among my friends, and in a little
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51633:60"/> time I recuperated my priſtine glory, living in as great content as ever. But being tormented with the treacheries of <hi>Agauve,</hi> who by hired Aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ms en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to deprive me of my life, not thinking her ſelfe ſafe whilſt there remained a witneſſe of her cruelty, I was forc'd for my owne ſafety to write to her, not to perſiſt in ſeeking my life unleſſe ſhe would force me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her, and to reſt contented that the child being dead, <hi>I</hi> intended not to diſcover, but only to deteſt her cruelty, and inhumanity. I believe thoſe few lines I ſent her gave her ſatisfaction, eſpecially when ſhe underſtood that <hi>Palemedon</hi> was dead, for after that <hi>I</hi> heard no more from her, but remained free from her aſſaſinous attempts.</p>
               <p>Long it was not before I was once more conſtrained, to leave the happy ſorte of Content, pleaſure, and quietude, being forced thence by the Shaftes of that ſworne enemie of my reſt <hi>Cupid.</hi> My age nor all my former miſeries were bulwarks ſufficient to keep off his fires, nor free me from thoſe paſſions which had ever been my ruine. Alas as if <hi>I</hi> had been born onely to love, or as if it had been my naturall element, wherein I was only to live, I could not have had a more propenſitie to it, I once more found my frozen years mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away with loves ardors and that over youthfull God inſpired me with his youthfull flames, and with <hi>Medean</hi> art brought back the ſpring of my age, makeing it finde a repulluation under the heate of his fires. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this laſt love was a widow, in whom beauty and wit equally ſtrove for maſterſhip; her birth was noble but her fortune meane, which made her exerciſe her wit to maintaine her ſtate, being alſo touched with that plague Ambition, the mother of all miſchief, and the wicked Daemon's eldeſt daughter. The Gods thwarted my other loves, and made me loſe that which I ſought to obtain, for which I rendered them a thouſand reproaches accounting them enemies to my happineſſe, therefore it was Juſt that I ſhould acknowledge the plagues of my own acquirements, and ſee that the Gods in denying, were friends to my happineſſe. <hi>I</hi> obtained what I ardently deſired; being ſhe whom <hi>I</hi> Sought deſired it no leſſe, not out of love, but ambition and avarice, hopeing to make a Son that ſhe had heire of that eſtate I poſſeſt. Content cannot laſt long where mutuall love tyeth not the affections, the love I bore her ſerv'd but to extinguiſh my reaſon and blinde my eyes from Seeing her projects, and the reſpect, ſhe bore me was but forc'd for her own intereſt, and till ſhe had made her ſelfe maſter of what I held.</p>
               <p>The firſt appearing of her enmity was at my denial of certaine unreaſonable demands for her ſon. Wherein ſhe exhibited that her deſire was for nothing more then my death, and that the advancement of her ſon was the ſcope of all her projects; however though it was too apparent not to be ſeen, yet could <hi>I</hi> not uſe any remedy againſt it. Five yeares having conſumed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſince our marriage, her deſires being growne too bigg to be contained within its limits, and her projects being fully ripned, ſhe ſuddenly effected them, for having great friends among the <hi>Romans,</hi> through their aide ſhe poſſeſſed her ſelfe of all I had, and by force, maintained her ſelfe in it, uſeing me as her profeſt foe, and would (could ſhe have effected it) have put a period to my dayes.</p>
               <p>Love that before appeared to me as the moſt beautifull goddeſſe, and with a luſter that begat her adoration, now ſeemed to be converted into a moſt ugly <hi>Erinnrs,</hi> worthy of all deteſtation; the ſcales began to fall from my eyes, and I began to ſee my folly, and to recount thoſe enormities it had made me run into, and finaly recovering my reaſon I profeſt my ſelfe a foe to that paſſion, which before <hi>I</hi> ſo much obſerved. Endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuperate that which was violently withheld from me, I in ſome time effected it with the aide of my friends, where I ſpent ſome more years, but being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51633:60"/> to the complotting of my wife and her Sonne, having a deſire to ſpend the reſt of my dayes in contemplation, in a place free from the acceſſe of men I ſould my eſtate and leaving my ungracious perſecutreſſe, taking with me the two Sons of <hi>Laſcaris</hi> and very few ſervants elſe, I repaired to this place, being known to me to be a place as full of pleaſure as Solitude, and where I might be free from the perquiſitions of my friends, and plotts of my enemies. By the way to this place I happily met with <hi>Lonoxia,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding each others fortunes, being tyed with a mutual Love and friendſhip, we reſolved to ſpend the remainder of our dayes together. This place being deſigned for our habitation, we added art to perfect nature, and by the help of both we compleated this domicile as you ſee, in which we have ſpent ſome yeares without any evenement, or ſeeing any ſtranger but your ſelfe, beeing a place ſo unfrequented, and this adjoyning grove being the utmoſt of our ambulations.</p>
               <p>Here neither the troubles of Love, or armes aſſolt us; here neither the envies or plots of our enemies annoy us; here quietude and peace accompany us, and here being ſequeſtred from the world, the knowledge of its affairs doth not deturb us, but being naruralized to this ſolitude, we finde a pleaſure which all the Empires of the world cannot give us. I have now concluded my narration wherein you cannot but perſpiciouſly ſee, (if that paſſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you are ſo inbued hath not already exoculated you) that <hi>Love</hi> hath been the cauſe of my miſeries made me the Sport of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and tyraniouſly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over my <hi>Liberty,</hi> and who laſtly with ſo many viciſſitudes hath made me an abject to my ſelf.</p>

This diſtinguiſheth <hi>Luſt</hi> from <hi>Love,</hi> for <hi>Love</hi> without <hi>virtue</hi> is <hi>Luſt</hi> and <hi>Luſt</hi> concatinated to <hi>virtue</hi> is <hi>Love.</hi> This diſtinction (it may be) may be thought too groſſe, for the ſtricter, and more refined <hi>Lovers,</hi> will not admit of <hi>Luſt,</hi> though as I conceive it is the ſame which they call <hi>deſire,</hi> which being involved in the actions of <hi>virtue</hi> and as it were chain'd to it, it cannot be perceiv'd to have a being, and therefore ſo refined <hi>Luſt</hi> is imperceivable, and wholly converted to <hi>love. Love</hi> (ſome diſtinguiſh thus) undetermined is <hi>Luſt, Luſt</hi> determined to one, <hi>Love.</hi> This cannot be to thoſe who (as you ſay) <hi>Love</hi> without deſire, for it muſt be a ſenſual deſire of pleaſure, to all, or more than one, nay or limited to one, that we rightly call <hi>Luſt,</hi> for indeed we change not the quality in our deſire or <hi>love</hi> to one, but the exorbitancy which regulated is called <hi>Love.</hi> Now it remains doubtfull to me whether <hi>man,</hi> (as you have inſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is not barely formoſity, beauty, wit, or any other exterior object, or quality of the beloved that cauſeth <hi>Love,</hi> (though all theſe in themſelves are lovely, and communicate a kind of pleaſure in the beholding them) were there not <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>fruition</hi> alſo in the <hi>Lover;</hi> for to love without <hi>deſire,</hi> is to love without reſpect either to perſons or ſex, which is the property of the gods and their celeſtial Miniſters alone, not to admit of <hi>Paſsion,</hi> and

Even ſo the farther we are from the gods by <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But now I cannot ſee how man being compoſed with ſuch affections and paſſions, can be capable of this Love, without either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, paſſion, or deſire to love all alike. I am a little wide of what <hi>I</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, which was to ſhew that this paſſion, was not to be contemned as it was a paſsion, but as it was irregular; for I hold not with the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> that all paſſions and affections are wholly to be mortified, wholly ſlain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, but that they are to be regulated, according to the precepts of <hi>vertue.</hi> As <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>anger</hi> without moderation is irregular, and therefore to be ſhunned; but when our anger is turned into <hi>zeal</hi> for the gods, and the actions of vertue are uſed againſt others with moderation, we may make uſe of it to animate our ſelves, and ſtimulate our courage, againſt our enemies without peccation; and ſo Love regulated, is not to be culpated, but only the irregularities and enormities of it. To know that, is to accommodate it with vertue, and obſerve ſo long as vertue is predominate, and rules it, it cannot but be a ſpur to glorious enterprizes and attchievements, leading into all vertuous actions, giving no cauſe of complaint, and never (as you complain) deprives man of his Reaſon, but quickens and enlightens his <hi>understanding.</hi> But now if this ſwerve any thing from <hi>vertue</hi> that I call irregular, and acknowledge it worthy of deteſtation, for then thoſe perſons that follow the enormities of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, are ruled by it according to the variety of humours of their fancies, and acting oft times contrary to reaſon, become notorious in their follies. And (laſtly) though men cannot have the power to decuſs this paſſion, being innate, yet they may have that power if they will as not to ſwerve from the rules of vertue, and then though love cauſe egritude, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets, yet it is not vicious, ſo that we muſt thus diſtinguſh the paſſion from the enormities the paſſion will lead us into, unleſs reſtrained by <hi>vertue.</hi>

                  <p>IT is a vanity (not to be born) of ſome continually to Jactate of the the antiquity, glory, and opulency, of their Anceſtors, whereby they fill themſelves like ſo many full-blown-bladders, and become a foot ball for the calcations of the wiſe. Virtue not birth or riches at firſt wan the prize of Glory, but their ſucceſſors thought it enough to weare their badg without making themſelves worthy of it, glorying that their predeceſſors had been thus and thus, So that greateneſſe is now of the higheſt eſteem and virtue little regarded, it being pretenſe enough for ſome to obnubilate their own vices, by exhibiting the vertue of their anceſtors.</p>
                  <p>To avoyd this crime therefore, I will not ſtand to declare, ether the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, opulency, virtue, or vices of my parents, thereby either to hide my vices with their virtues, or to ſet off any virtue of mine by their vices. But indeed the Gods favoured me with an honourable birth, though they have disfavoured me with a wretched Life. The country of <hi>Mauritania Tingitana</hi> claimes my Birth and Education, and more particularly the town of <hi>Lixus.</hi> The antiquity of our houſe was there well known, which I wave as a thing frivolous for the furtherance of virtue. My fathers name was <hi>Marcipſius</hi> brother to King <hi>Bogadus</hi> who unhappily fell under the ſword of the renowned <hi>Agrippa,</hi> at the battel of <hi>Actium,</hi> takeing the part of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicit <hi>Antony.</hi> I had two brothers elder than my ſelf, the eldeſt was nam'd as my father, the other was call'd <hi>Maſſaniſſa.</hi> I was but young at that time when my uncle <hi>Bogadus</hi> was ſlain, and my father not affecting thoſe glorious cares of a Crown, (the war immediately following) he kept cloſe in <hi>Lixus</hi> without med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in thoſe broyles.</p>
                  <p>But my brother <hi>Marcipſius</hi> being of a ſtirring nature went into <hi>Aegypt</hi> till the war being ended, with the death of <hi>Antonius,</hi> when returning he hop'd to attain the crown, but being oppoſ'd; there grew great broyles which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſome years, till <hi>Marcipſius</hi> was driven out of <hi>Africk,</hi> where he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from us three years. At laſt <hi>Marcipſius</hi> returns and tells us of many ſtrange occurrents that had hapned to him in <hi>Spain</hi> and other places, our parents were full of Ioy for his ſafe arival, whom they had feared had been Loſt. I was now arrived at 15 years of age, and began now not to fear the

I would not boaſt my ſelf of theſe things, or glory in ſuch vanities, yet it is requiſite that I acknowledg the favour and benevolence of the Gods, ſeing it is at their pleaſure to give either knowledg, or ſtrength to whom they pleaſe. But however that my ſtudies chain'd me within dores, yet had <hi>I</hi> a peculiar inclination to the actions of <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> thought <hi>Mars</hi> and the <hi>Muſes</hi> would do very well together, and as ſoon as <hi>I</hi> arrived at this age of puberty, it exhibited my great deſire to armes, which my father, (being carefull to further my inclinations, as far as they tended to virtue) perceiving, provided excellent tutors for me, together with my brother <hi>Maſſaniſsa,</hi> we learnd under one maſter who ſought impartially to Inſtrct us, and to imbue us with the beſt of his skill, but in that martiall diſcipline I did precell, which augmented his hatred and made it implac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, <hi>I</hi> often found it in many injuries and affronts which I had borne all my life time patiently enough, but now I could no longer reſent them, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petially when I ſaw both of them deſir'd no leſſe than my Life, ſuch are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations of Envy, that anothers proſperity is their plague, and anothers ruin their delight though nothing accrews to them thereby. I had pretty well found the uſe of my weapons, and could uſe with them dexterity enough, either for defence or oppoſition, when <hi>Marcipſius</hi> returned out of <hi>Spain, Marcipſius</hi> hating me no leſſe than <hi>Maſsaniſsa,</hi> ſought all occaſions of quarreling, and under pretence of trying me at my weapons would endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to take away my Life, and ſometimes would put me to my ſhift to ſave it, and to come off with conſiderable wounds. Having been dealt withall ſo once or twice, I took heed how I fell into their clutches and avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all occaſions I could of offending them, uſeing thoſe advantages the Gods had given me, with as much modeſty and humility, as could be required. I ſought with meekneſſe to overcome their envie, but alas! it was too ſtrong for Love to Conquer. I dayly found it to encreaſe, and the Injuries that <hi>I</hi> receiv'd were allmoſt innumerable, inſo much that it defatigated my patience, and made a <hi>Tedium</hi> of my life.</p>
                  <p>But now the time was come wherein my unlucky hand freed my ſelf of theſe miſeries, but involv'd my ſelf in far worſer dolors; one day which was very inauſpicate, <hi>Maſsaniſsa</hi> being with me in a garden adjacent to our houſe, upon ſome ſmall differnce between us about Caſting of our darts, ſtroke me a box on the eare, adding ſome Stimulating ſpeeches: which provokement banniſht all former fear and naturall Love, filling me with wrath and diſdaine. My paſſion blinding my reaſon, gave me no liberty to thinke into what precipices I ſlung my ſelf, but drawing my ſword I ſhew'd him it was impoſſible for me any longer to take his affronts. <hi>Maſsaniſsa</hi> not declineing this unnaturall combate, oppoſed me with his ſword, and expreſſed a deſire to end all quarrels with a duell. We both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted this fight with ſtrange fury, no hatred being ſo ſtrong as that between brothers, yet had I had ever ſo little reſpite my reaſon would have overcome my paſſion, but this duell was ſoon Conſummated, for at the third thruſt I paſſed my ſword thorow his body, tumbling him dead at my feet. Then, and not till then, did I conſider what I had perpetrated, Remorſe, ſtraight ways ſeized upon me, and Repentence converted my eyes before dry'd with anger, and flaming with wrath, into ſtanding pooles, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing diſcharg'd themſelves into Rivers of tears, all the faculties of my ſoul were now turn'd into grief, all ceaſing their operations to give this the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51633:63"/> more ſcope, At laſt ſeeking to revive him with the eyes of pity, I caſt my ſelf upon him, mingling teares of repentence with his crimſon blood, and waſhing his wounds with thoſe diſtillations, addreſſing vaine implorations for forgiveneſſe, whilſt he expir'd in my armes. When I ſaw that he had yeilded to fate, new conſiderations unlockt new ſprings, till the exceſſe of grief had froze thoſe currents to my cheekes, and had as it were converted me into a marble ſtatue, wherein was neither life nor motion.</p>
                  <p>In this poſture my father and my brother <hi>Marcipſius</hi> coming Caſually into the garden found me, and ſeeing me at a diſtance, with one lying by me, approperated as to behold ſome novelty, but appropinquating they ſoon beheld that ſad ſpectacle. So ſudden and unexpected an in counter, put them into an aſtoniſhment, and takeing away the faculty of Speech, left them no power, but by their eyes to demand the cauſe of his death. My Conſcience interpreting the dum language of their eyes, I caſt my ſelf at the feet of my father and with out excuſes, punctually and truely, related what had hapned betwixt us. <hi>Marcipſius</hi> not more ſorry for the death <hi>Maſsaniſsa</hi> than glad that I had ſlaine him, that the wrath of my father might immolate me to the Ghoſt of my brother, ſtimulated him to excecute his reſentments immediately upon me, who provoked equally with his words and paſſion devaginated his ſword to have ſlain me. But I, ſtartled to ſee death appear in the hand of him who gave me life, conſented to the preſent motion of my ſpirits, and fled the furie of his wrathfull hand. Wrath invigorating his ancient limbs, made him follow me with nimble ſtrides, but yet my velocity left him behinde ſome paces, and fear made me too nimble for winged death, who carrying me into the armes of my mother made her prove the Coale of Life. For meeting her at the entrance into the houſe I caſt my ſelf at her feet. As you have been the author of my being (ſaid <hi>I</hi>) ſo now it is you only can preſerve it, but that I cannot begge, ſeeing I have been the diſtruction of anothers in whom you had a maternal intereſt, ſuffer me only to disburden my Life at your feet—, the approach of my father, ſtifled the reſt of my wordes; my mother agaſt at this incounter could not reply, but trembling in this aſtoniſhment, ſhe ſtood till the exceeding love ſhe bore me excited her for my ſafety, aſſoon as ſhe ſaw at whom the wrath of my father extended. Caſting her ſelf therefore at his feet, ſhe ſo ſtrictly embraced his knees, that ſhe ſtopt his further purſute, and overcame his ſtrugling, with her ſtrickt embraces, mingling her tears with plaintive words, and thoſe with ſuch overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing geſtures, that ſhe ſtifled his fury, and made him withhold his eger revenge, to give her an account of what had hapned, biding her not to retard that Juſtice he ought to inflict upon a murtherer. Her tears ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped her words for ſome time, both in conſideration of <hi>Maſsaniſsa</hi>'s loſſe, and my danger, but at laſt to appeaſe his wrath, ſtill embraceing him on her knees, ſhe ſought to mitigate him with implorative words to this effect. Ah ſad diſaſter, Ah double miſſerie; wherein the blood of one Son muſt be the oblation for the blood of another! Ah! thinke you not my miſerie great enough to loſe one Son, but that I muſt ſee another alſo fall by the hand of his own father! Let my teares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you to conſider firſt, the action, before you perpetrate any thing in your wrath; for that cannot be done in juſtice which is ballanc'd by paſſion, for if you do it now, it is not ſo much for ſatisfaction of the Gods, as of your ſelf and paſsion, and not ſo much in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Juſtice, as for to fulfill the effects of your wrath. I will not in the leaſt excuſe his wicked perpetration, for <hi>I</hi> cannot have leſſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the death of <hi>Maſsaniſsa</hi> than your ſelf, but yet in puniſhing <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxia</hi>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:51633:64"/> by death we ſhall augment our evil by a double loſſe, beſides I find too much imbicility to withſtand another ſurcharge which this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſlaughter will inevitably bring upon me, it will be impoſſible but that <hi>I</hi> ſhall make one in the Tragedy, therefore at leaſt ſpare him his life and execute Juſtice by ſome way leſſe ſevere, rather baniſh him, and diſowne him for your ſon, than he being a ſon ſhould be ſlain by the hand of a father, in which you will ſhew ſome mercy as a father, and yet not fail of the duty of a Judge. Theſe and many other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions her motherly affection emitted to ſave my life, which could not but overcome the heart of my father, had it been much harder, her words being accompanied with ſhowers of teares, and her ſighs ſeeming ſtops in the dolefull harmony of her words; and her actions harmonizeing with her plaintive voyce, alltogether ſent forceable penetrations to the ſoul of <hi>Marcipſius,</hi> who ever bearing great love to my mother, could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine them, without the exaction of ſome teares. But yet to be juſt, though he conſented to ſpare me my Life, he commanded that <hi>I</hi> ſhould immediately leave that Country, and ſee him no more, leaſt my fight ſhould inſtigate him to that which through the perſwaſions of my mother he had omitted. This was greif enough to my mother, and gave anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not to be known but by ſuch who have had the like affection, and the like diſaſters. I ſoon underſtood the doome my father had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd which <hi>I</hi> receiv'd with the like welcome as I ſhould have done my death, it was no ſmall grief for me to leave my friends at that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant age, and to expoſe my ſelf to all thoſe dangers incident to thoſe that traverſe the world, being hardly yet freed from the tender cockering of a mother, but ſeeing it was inevitable <hi>I</hi> prepared for it with all the Courage and animoſity my grief had left me, then indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being the time to try courage, when we are inviron'd with ſtraites and difficulties. When evils force themſelves upon us, we willingly endure ſome pain to avoyde greater, and of two inevitable evils it is Judgement to chuſe the leaſt, my mother alittle before I departed came to me, rather to haſten me than to ſtay me, Love ſeeming to act againſt it ſelf, in cauſeing her to haſten that from her, which ſhe deſired extreamly to keep with her, but this ſhe did, as it were, with a willing reluctancie, ſeeing it was the only means to preſerve me from ruin, for my brother <hi>Marcipſius</hi> enraged that I had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the furie of my father, and not content with my baniſhment, ſought to inſtigate him againſt me, and himſelf endeavouring to have ſlain me, made my mother, fearing his maliciouſneſſe, to haſten me from his power. But in receiving her laſt embraces, the ſleuces of her eyes being ſet wide open, there guſht forth ſo impetuous a ſtream, that I thought her life would have been diſſolved in her teares, or that it would have expir'd through her eyes, which paſſion generating the like in me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted all my remaining waters, powring them out to accompany her in her lachrymations. But at laſt the approach of the ſilent night en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc't her to unlock her armes and free me from her Strict embraces, kiſſing my forehead with a dying f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rewell, for I left her rather dead than alive in the armes of her maids. Having thus left my mother without further ſtay <hi>I</hi> arm'd my ſelf, and takeing that gold and jewels ſhe had provided for me, I left the place of my birth, not admitting any one to accompany me, though many preſt to have followed me. But by reaſon that it was night I remained in <hi>Lixus</hi> till the next day, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to tranſport my ſelf in the next ſhip that went out of the haven, not much careing into what quarter of the world it carried me.</p>
                  <p>Having wearied my ſelfe with the languiſhments of that night, I aroſe aſſoon as the bright day-bringer appeared in our Horizon, and going to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51633:64"/> the Haven I embarqu'd my ſelf in a ſhip going into <hi>Spain,</hi> Which was not fuller fraught with paſſengers and commodities, than <hi>I</hi> with miſery and woe. There is none that leave their native home, and travell into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts, and that expoſe them ſelves to the imminent dangers both of Sea and land; but that they ſhall finde that mutable power playing her capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioes upon their fortunes, ſometimes adulateing them with ſucceſſes contrary to their expectations, ſeeming to felicitate them with the fruition of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their deſires, that ſo they may receive the greater and more ſenſible miſery, for the loſs of that which we never had, cannot affect us ſo much as that which we have enjoy'd, and this ſhe effects ſo ſuddenly that we receive as much dammage by the ſurprize, as by the loſſe it ſelf; therefore we may very juſtly reflect when in proſperity, how ſoon we may be caſt into adverſity, and that when we are in the greateſt adverſity, there is ſtill hopes of attaining as great proſperity, ſince there is nothing more contrary to fortune than to retain a man long in the ſame condition, whether it be good or bad, which equally Shares her benedictions and her execrations from the ſame mouth. So hath ſhe delt with me in exhibiting ſtrange viciſſitudes in the ſeries of my life, ſometimes filling me with content, ſometimes diſtracting me with dolors.</p>
                  <p>The ſhip wherein I went continued a happy courſe till ſhe arrived at the port to which ſhe was bound, which was to <hi>Oliſſippo</hi> a city ſtanding at the mouth of the golden-ſanded <hi>Tagus,</hi> there <hi>I</hi> diſembarqu'd after a thouſand prayers to the Gods to reſent my miſeries, and to eaſe me of my dolors, which were all conſummated and buried in oblivion by a ſhaft from the quiver of the winged god.</p>
                  <p>After ſome few days being in the City, having quite tired my ſelf with reſenting my griefes, Curioſity inſpir'd me with deſires to ſee the City, and to view the inſigne building and places thereof, alſo to refreſh my body, laſſated with the troubles of my ſoul. Conſenting to this motion, I deambulated through the City, and endeavoured to ſatisfie my curioſity, and to divert my ſelfe with beholding all things obſervable or worth take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice of. Having ſpent ſome howers in this perluſtration I went out of the city, and walking along upon the banke of the <hi>Tagus</hi> within a bow ſhoote of the City where the river made a little Iland I obſerv'd a very ſpatious houſe to occupy one part, and fair groves and delicate gardens the other; it ſeem'd to be a very pleaſant place and full of delight, the golden <hi>Tagus</hi> circumplectating its bankes, ſeemed to hugg it as its cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt glory. Whilſt I ſtood under the ſhelter of ſome trees that grew by the river ſide obſerving the ſite of the houſe, and conſidering how delightfully nature had furniſht that amnick plot, I beheld a caſement of the window to open, which ſtood juſt opoſite to me, and caſting up my eyes, I ſaw (though at a diſtance) a beauty which perſtring'd them through the gard of the trees un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which I ſtood. The diſtance of the place hindred the exact intuition of her, and obſcur'd all thoſe lineaments that rendred her exquiſite, but neither that not the trees thorow which <hi>I</hi> look'd nor the interpoſition of the River could hinder thoſe ſhafts that proceeded from her eyes, from transfixing my heart. Though I perceiv'd a naturall vivacitie in her eyes, yet her complection ſhew'd that affliction had rob'd her of her colour, and her eyes ſeem'd a little to ſhelter themſelves behinde a cloude of ſorrow, which yet was no hinderance to thoſe winged ſhafts, but rather made way, my ſoul Sympathizeing with her grieved looks: Her Countenance was more than ordinary albious, yet it nad not utterly loſt that tincture which makes a deſireable mixture; which perſwaded me that her paleneſſe was acquired either by greif or ſome other indiſpoſition, and not naturall, which was confirm'd when I ſaw her make uſe of her hankerchiefe to catch the pearles that dropt from her eyes.</p>
                  <p>I almoſt loſt my ſelfe in this intuition, and having ſo convenient a place
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51633:65"/> and finding it ſo delightful, <hi>I</hi> ſought to ſatiate my eyes with the food of beauty, but that (contrary to the nature of other aliment) inſtead of ſaturity, begat a greater eſurition, &amp; made my appetite increaſe with beholding.</p>
                  <p>But at laſt this delicate banquet withdrew it ſelf, the Lady ſhutting the caſement excluded my piercing eyes from that beloved Object. <hi>Sol</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning now to immerge himſelf in the <hi>Atlantick</hi> ocean <hi>I</hi> retired from that place, and with gentle ſteps retrod the path upon the bank of the river <hi>Tagus,</hi> extreamly affected with the intuition of that delicate (but unknown) Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: <hi>I</hi> found divers agitations in my ſpirits, which at I firſt took to be the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary effects of divers beautifull objects, which have a certain oppera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive virtue on a gentle ſoule, ſo that they can hardly be intuited without affection, and deſire, all delectable and amiable objects being deſireable in themſelves, and eſpecially to ſoules who are adapted to Love. My ſoul was too tender not to receive the impreſſion of that venuſt exhibition, and not to be delighted with that Lovely object, but yet my former thoughts made me ſtrive to ſtop the diſcurſion of my Imagination, and to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the ſpecies of the object: but for all my endeavours it would ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelfe to my fancy, and awake all the powers and faculties of my ſoule to an intenſe contemplation of that I endeavoured to diſcuſſe. Nor did time (the conſumer of all things) annihilate this ſpecies, for in the ſpace of a week I ſound it got ground upon my will, and was become almoſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual. <hi>I</hi> alſo perceived my former dolors decreaſe as this augmented, this begining to engroſſe all the working of my fancie to it's ſelfe, So that at laſt I had quite loſt or extinguiſhed my former trouble. I was yet ſo ſimple as not to know how to denominate this paſſion, and I durſt not think it was Love, being affraid of that monſter which <hi>I</hi> had heard had precipitated ſo many ſoules, but in fine it grew ſo turbulent, and moleſtuous, that I knew not whether to thank the Gods for taking away the afflictions of my minde; or increpate them more for theſe new diſquiets. But though theſe diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſeemed greater than the other; yet were they mitigated with a kind of titil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or delight, which moderated the ſenſibility of them, and made as it were a kind of pleaſure in the midſt of paine, with an admirable mixture.

                  <p> Whilſt I was agitated with this paſſion, I aſſiduouſly traverſed the bankes of <hi>Tagus,</hi> and ſedulouſly watched for an appearance of that bright Sun which had begot thoſe reſtleſſe deſires. I oft circumvagated that <hi>Ile</hi> and left neither banke unviſited which ſtood oppoſit to it, ſtill hopeing to attaine that deſired ſight; but her great ſecluſion made ſome weeks paſſe away without the attainement of that inviſagement, which had left me almoſt bare of hopes. My ſedulitie yet continuing, and frequenting that place as I uſed to doe; I ſat me downe under the covert of certaine trees, tho row whoſe bows I had a favourable proſpect to the houſe. At that time having long contemplated on divers things, leaning my head againſt the body of a tree I was ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprived of the act of ſenſe, reſolving all my Imaginations into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſleep; which acting upon the ſpecies of viſible objects exſuſcitated many pleaſing dreames that held me paſt my wonted time of return, which was uſually preſently after <hi>Sol</hi> had left our <hi>Hemiſphere.</hi> But awaking from the pleaſing fancies of ſleepe, I found that the night had begun to inherit the place of day, and faire <hi>Cynthia</hi> in her perfecteſt forme began to enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the ſuperficies of the waters with her refulgent beames. <hi>I</hi> was about to depart when a ſudden noyſe in the water ſurprized my eares, which made me circumſpect to ſee what it might be: creeping without obſtrepancie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the obumbrating boughs cloſe to the banke of the river, I perceiv'd that it was the daſhing of oares in the water that had reverberated the aire to my eares. The fulgency of <hi>Luna</hi> made every thing perſpicuous on the river, ſo that I ſaw the remigers of the little boate which ſeemed newly to be put off from the little Iſland) were ſix virgins, whoſe tender armes performed that office very artificially, the water willingly giving way to their gentle ſtrokes. At the head of the boate under a canopie of ſilke Sate two women for whoſe pleaſure the others made many turns upon the water with their boat, to delight them with that aquatick recreation. <hi>I</hi> avidiouſly attracted the boate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſhore with my eyes, believing one of them to be the ſame I had beheld with that perturbation that had accompanied me ever ſince. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected incounter made me to watch the motion of the boate with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, which at laſt came gliding down the ſtream cloſe by the banke where I lay ſo that I perſpicuouſly ſaw one of them to be a woman of great gravity, but imediatly leaving that object I caſt my eyes upon the other whom I preſently knew to be ſame faire one that had involved my ſoule into ſuch perplexities. This ſight cauſed a generall ſhivering through all my body, and I could not behold her without perturbation. I had little time by reaſon of the ſwiftneſſe of the boate to behold thoſe perfections, but by the dimme light of the Moon <hi>I</hi> ſaw they ſurpaſt thoſe which I had before ſeen at a diſtance, and her <hi>Idea</hi> was more perfectly renewed in my ſoule; and with a more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power over my will. The boate being paſt a little beyond me was ſtayed againſt the banke by the force of the oares, and <hi>Atalanta</hi> with the other woman (which was her governeſſe) came on ſhore, the other awaiting their returne in the boate.

Being layd in this order I caſt my eyes through the diviſions of the ſhrubs to behold the deambulation of <hi>Atalanta,</hi> who came with no vulger grace being upheld by the other woman. Her ſtature neither too low nor too procerous, the faſhion of her clothes ſhewed ſhe was in her night dreſſe, but they were ſuch that with their nigritude ſet off the albitude of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Her body was ſhrouded under a garment of rich ſilke, the color being undiſcerneble at that time, but it was made ſo long that trailing upon the graſſe it might renew its verdue by the happy kiſſes of her garment; over her ſhoulders was ſlung a night mantle which was lined with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51633:66"/> the furs of delicate ermine, and in which ſhe wrapped her armes as ſhe wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; the principall part of that rare compoſure was inveloped in a <hi>ſable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitium</hi> which exhibited her face like bright <hi>Cinthia's,</hi> when ſurrounded with cloudes, and her eyes like two ſtars gave a luſter where e're ſhe went: their pace was but gentle, which favoured me with the more time for the intuition of the perfections of this dame; I perceiv'd they had entred into diſcourſe before I could audite their words, but by their approach the harmony of her voyce began to ſtrike my eare, and for that I hop'd to gather ſomething by my curioſity out of their diſcourſe, all the faculties of my ſoul contributed their powers to my eyes and eares, out of which ports ſhe was almoſt attracted through the exceſſe of pleaſure ſhe received. But the words that in my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were form'd between thoſe couralls I beheld, were to this effect. Ah mother, (ſaid ſhe anſwering to ſome thing the other had ſpoken) you who ought to be more ſevere, are too too lenitive to one ſo ſinfull. But what comfort can I have, in liveing after ſuch tranſgreſſions. Surely the Gods will pity me in taking away that life, which you will not permit to be offered as a libament to their indignation.</p>
                  <p>How often have you promiſed to yield your ſelfe to my tuitions (replyed her tutoreſſe) and how often have you promiſed not to afflict your ſelf in this manner? The gods do not require ſo much grief at your hands, ſeeing you have unfeignedly repented, and if you doe more than they require that ſurpluſſage is by them unregarded, being we are not to be immoderate no not in the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our ſelves for good. It is a ſign of too great abjection not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and too much miſtruſting the mercie and pity of the Gods, when you ſtill retain ſuch thoughts of their wrath. It is not the life they require but the heart, and that, through an unfeign'd repentance you have rendred into their hands, ſo that from this iniquity your good proceedeth, who elſe (it may be) would not have repented or implored their mercy, ſo wonderfull are their incomprehenſible wayes that they even raiſe us to thrones of glory by the ſteps of ſin, for trampling that under our feet we mount to their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſeates, and it is a ſign that they love them moſt to whom they forgive moſt iniquities; and what they forgive ought not to be remembred by us. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talanta</hi> all that while prodigal of her pearls exhauſted all the treaſure of her eyes, which touching my heart with an inward ſympathy, extracted moiſt tears, and ſcalding ſighs, out of my inflamed breaſt. But ſhe thus returned to her woman: you are alwayes the Gods meſſenger of peace, and you ſo much conſcionate their benignity and miſeration, that the remembrance of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuch afflicts me more. I doe not doubt or miſtruſt their power, but how—They were ſo far tranſpaſt me that I could not hear her ſequent words, but as they returned aſſoon as her words were articulate to my ear, I greedily liſned to theſe.—no no all men are falſe and I cannot believe any after the perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſo many oathes and vowes: Is it not pity the Gods ſuffer ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities unpuniſht? This ſecluſion delights me moſt, and if ever I eſcape that danger wherein my folly hath precipitated me, I will never forſake this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, but end my dayes in the company of my maids, and will not ſo much as defile my eyes with the ſight of that falſe ſex; that wicked ſex! ſince they build their wickedneſſes on our weakneſſes. My father hath indulg'd me to live in this place, which I hope he will continue ſo long as I live, a thing moſt conſentanious to my deſires, and whereby I ſhall receive ſome felicity in that <hi>I</hi> live without renewing my ſorrow by the ſight of men. Come leave theſe diſcontents, (ſaid the other) and do not deject your ſelfe, your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour—they were again paſt ſo farr beyond me, and ſpeaking ſoe ſubmiſſe that their words dy'd before they came to my audition, ſo that this was all I heard of that ambiguous Colloquie. They at length reentered their boate which floated againſt the ſtream hard by the place where I lay, compelled to it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51633:66"/> by virgin-ſtroakes, which gave me opportunity to let my eyes take their fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of that rare object, and ſo to accompany her boate till it was arived on the other ſide, where it was admitted into a little Creek under the obum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of certain Oſiers.</p>
                  <p>I had no ſooner loſt the ſight of the boat, that carried away the object of my fancie, but as it were awaking out of a pleaſing dreame I began to recogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the words I heard, and ſo ſet the <hi>Image</hi> of that new-loſt object before my Imagination, that I might conſider the particular perfections of it, which I was incapable of before, through the intention of my ſoule upon the whole. But in recounting the words I had heard <hi>I</hi> could not find out the cauſe of that Ladyes affliction, but that it was ſome great Injury that ſhe had receiv'd from ſome barbarous one of our ſex, which made her ſo out of Charity with all men, but <hi>I</hi> was reſolv'd to repair that breach with the truth, obedience and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I had vow'd to ſerve her with.</p>
                  <p>There was no room left now for any doubt or oppoſition to my love, this ſecond inviſagement had totally overcome me, and all my thoughts were now buſied in contrivances which way to ſerve her, but that I found ſo difficult, by reaſon of her ſecluſion, and what I had learn'd out of that interrupted diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, of her great averſion to men, that I was even almoſt paſt the bounds of hope. I ſet all my thoughts on the wrack of invention, where I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to extend them to ſome happy reſult, but I had no ſooner accepted this project, but either ſome difficulty or ſomething more convenient daſht it; and it may be whilſt <hi>I</hi> was conſidering on that, diverſe unſeen objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſuddenly ſtarting up made that alſo of no effect, <hi>I</hi> ſpent good part of my thoughts, and good part of the night in ſuch none effectuall projections, till at laſt remembring my ſelf I aroſe, and bid farewell to that place that had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured me with the happy and long'd for intuition of <hi>Atalanta.</hi>

                  <p>I had not gone many paces before I heard a whiſpering which in the ſilent night beat the aire up the river to my eares: The laſt evenement; and good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that I received by my curioſity; made me to forgoe no occaſion of furthering my fortunes by thoſe private auditions. Standing ſtill to liſten af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe confuſed voyces that I heard, I could not hear any thing diſtinctly but the repetition of my own name, which amazing me made me think it the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of my fancy, for I had not communicated it to any in the City, and I was utterly unknown to them all, but the noiſe ſtill continuing I mov'd ſoftly that way under the umbration of the boughs that adorned the bankes of the <hi>Tagus.</hi> At laſt I perceived that the ſuſurration had proceeded from the intermixing voyces of a man and a woman, who ſtood talking cloſe under the wall of the City. I was now got cloſe enough to underſtand what they ſaid &amp; lying upon the ground hid from their eyes by the procerous graſſe I heard words to this effect. Come (ſaies the man) let's nor ſtay any longer, leaſt we be ſuſpected, we may effect it to morrow night well enough. But what (ſaies the woman as I thought) if <hi>Lonoxia,</hi> ſhould have diſcovered us? There's no fear of that (ſayes the other) he knows us not, and this was mere chance that he was from home this night. It was well for him (reply'd the other) I had ſoon diſpatch him elſe; we muſt not miſſe the next nights oportunity, leſt he leave this place, which might coſt us a world of paines to finde him againe, and we muſt doe it before we return or elſe <hi>Marcipſius</hi> will hang us for our paines.</p>
                  <p>I do not care (ſaid the other) how ſoon it be effected that we may return and receive our reward, for I tell you truly that I do it for no affection to him, but for that which he promiſed if we effect it, and when I have received that, if another will give me as much Ile ſerve him the ſame ſauce. You need not fear (ſays the other) but he will be a maſter good enough, <hi>Lonoxia</hi> wont be the laſt that he will deſire to rid out of his way, his father is a hindrance to be

Whilſt I lay confounded at what <hi>I</hi> had heard from theſe aſſaſins, that counterſit uncloath'd himſelfe of his womaniſh apparell, haveing under the habiliments of a man, a long skene hid under his veſtments. Thoſe garments that he had put off, he bund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up and put them into a vacuous hole in the wall, placeing ſome looſe ſtones at the mouth, which aſſoon as they had done they both departed, before I had power to awake my ſelfe out of the confuſion their wicked intentions had caſt me in; and the aſſaſinous intent of <hi>Marcipſious,</hi> who was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with my baniſhment but alſo muſt play the fratricide. But aſſoon as I could recall the baniſhment of my ſenſes; with more fury than judgement <hi>I</hi> followed them, to have anticipated their expectations, and have given them their condign puniſhment for their wicked intentions, but paſſion being guide <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe I err'd in the way, for I could not recover the ſight of them after they had entred the City, having traverſed thoſe places where I thought to have met them, and failing in my expectations, vext as I was <hi>I</hi> returned to the place where <hi>I</hi> firſt ſaw them, that inſtant producing an invention which prov'd very advantageous to my deſires, though difficult in the undertaking. Denoteing the place where that aſſaſin had hid his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable garments; I thought it no variation from the point of honeſty to rob him of thoſe wickedly-uſed veſtments, and haveing gotten them into my poſſeſſion I returned (being very late) into the City to my habitation, not without thanks to the Gods, who not only gave me the ſo-much deſired intuition of <hi>Atalanta,</hi> but by that very meanes alſo preſerv'd my life, ſo wonderfull are their works, and unſearchable are their wayes and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary are their deſigns to thoſe of men, for thoſe garments which were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by thoſe aſſaſins, for to have been a means for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my death, and under which they had intended I ſhould have received my diſtruction, prov'd the only means of my life and joy, and under which I received all pleaſure and content.</p>
                  <p>That new injected project, which repreſented it ſelfe as good to my Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, ſtill working upon my fancy made me leave my habitacle of reſt with the earlieſt light, in order for the performance of that deſign out of which I had raiſed to my ſelfe a ſtructure of delicious hopes.

By this you may eaſily gueſſe at my intentions, and that I ſought for precedences how to become the more womaniſh.</p>
                  <p>This indeed was my deſign to illude fortune, and under a new diſguiſe to hide my ſelf from her injuries. I had indeed a minde to try, (ſince misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes had ever accompanied my vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In this place I began to <hi>Metamorphize</hi> my ſelfe, and to deveſt my ſelfe of my man-like garments, which having done putting a ſtone in the midſt of them bound together, I ſlung them into the midſt of the river, and my ſelfe after, to delave all ſpots, ſince <hi>I</hi> was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a new creature. There was now no going back from my determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, my cloathes were loſt in the river, and I muſt now reveſt my ſelfe with that new change or returne naked; but the refrigerous river could not cool my deſire, thoſe flames were too ardent to be quencht with thoſe waters. At laſt wearied with labouring my armes in that <hi>Crystall</hi> element I ſwam to the banke, and drying my ſelfe <hi>I</hi> put on thoſe veſtments, not without the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of fear, how I ſhould deport my ſelfe in that habit: but hope ſuppediting me with reſolutions I totally adorn'd my ſelfe with thoſe accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terments. The river was fain to be my <hi>Speculum,</hi> and my own hands the addorners of my ſelfe, but <hi>I</hi> made a ſhift to concinnate my ſelf in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome manner, and to adapt every thing, in its right mode. Having a while Conſidered my ſelf in the faint reflection of the water, I ſaw nothing diſſonant to the forme I had taken, and I believe had my own progenitors ſeen me, they had not known me. Nature ſeem'd to conſpire to this change having made my body exiguous, and not too procerous, and the infallable token of virility not yet appearing on my Chin, made me to referre the ſex I had feigned ſo much; that had not my ſelfe knowne to the contrary <hi>I</hi> ſhould not have immagined any fiction, I ſhould have thought I had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a true <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> had I not known that <hi>I</hi> retained ſomething that belonged to man, and I ſwear others muſt have known the like before they could have ſuſpected any thing, ſo much had that forme transformed me. A little formoſity that in thoſe young dayes nature had beſtowed upon me ſeemed to be much encreaſed, and it may be would in a vulgar eye have been called beauty, which I ſought to augement by laying out ſome cincin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat hair, that that might pleade for ſome pitty in the eyes of <hi>Atalanta, I</hi> found a great delight, and pleaſing my immagination in beholding my ſelf in the water, but at laſt fearing to runne the fortune of <hi>Narciſſus</hi> I withdrew my ſelf from that aquatick intuition, and began to exerciſe my thoughts to frame ſome ſigment to allude <hi>Atalanta,</hi> a ſin I confeſſe, but not to be voided at that time.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51633:68"/> what I thought convenient, I began to exerciſe my knees to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar flections of women, and to uſe my feet to their abulent geſture. But whilſt <hi>I</hi> ſpent the time in theſe exerciſes of body and mind, <hi>Sol</hi> had drencht the wheeles of his flagrant carruck, in the <hi>Atalantick</hi> waves, and had given leave for his ſilvered ſiſter to exhibit her borrowed ſplendor in his roome. Nevertheleſſe although I had aſſimulated, the Species of women, I had not altogether loſt the heart of a man, my inſide was not chang'd with my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, for feare, the inſeparable concomitant of that weaker ſex, did not poſſeſſe me in thoſe tenebrous ſhades, but walking in that happy <hi>Ambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrum</hi> where I had ſeen <hi>Atalanta</hi> the night before, I expected her with ardencie and fear.

This ſubitane ſurprize, and haſty exuſcitation from a condition, in which <hi>I</hi> did not dreame of her approach, had put all my praemeditated inventions and expreſſions clean out of my thoughts, and left me in ſuch a condition that without faining I acted to the very life the part of that imbeciller ſex <hi>I</hi> repreſented; At laſt recovering my ſurprize, and ſeeing <hi>Atalanta</hi> with her nurſe, and fower or five of her maides about me, all amazed at my amazedneſſe, and expecting when my tongue would break the priſon of my lips, I was forc't to leave collecting what before I had imagined, and make uſe of new injections agreable to that unexſpected evenement.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51633:69"/> that it was hard to ſay whether nature Imitated art, or art nature, in thoſe compartments and indentments of groves and walkes. It was a place fit indeed to be the receptacle of ſo fair a creature, and where pleaſure ſeem'd to glory in becoming a ſervant to her greatneſſe. Between that object of all my deſires and her tutoreſſe <hi>I</hi> was conducted along a moſt pleaſant walke which led from the place where we landed to the houſe, being ſet on each ſide and mingled alternately with yellow and orange coulour fruit-bearing trees, which gave ſo fragrant a ſmell that would have reviv'd a benummed ſenſe, and which ſurpaſſed the odours of the <hi>Arabick</hi> forreſts.</p>
                  <p>The fruites like thoſe of <hi>Alcinous</hi> hung with a continuall faireneſſe, and thoſe golden apples fairer than thoſe of the fabulated <hi>Heſperides</hi> hung like aureated ſtudds amoungſt the freſh verdure of their tremulous leaves, which delighted the optick ſence with their ſight, and the odorate with their fragrancies.

The touch of thoſe Rubies had allmoſt extracted my ſoul totally from my body, which fled to the portalls of its ſtructure that it might with more ardency receive the impreſſion of her lips. My ſenſes hardly exerciſeing their functions for ſome time after the receipt of that inflaming kiſſe, I exhibited an amazedneſſe in my looks, and hardly anſwered ſenſe to what ſhe ſaid, but at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering my ſelfe, and perceiving ſhe took notiſe of it, I excuſed it the beſt I could with theſe words.

After ſhe had put off an acceſſary mantle which ſerv'd to keep off the cold blaſts of the night, and that we had ſeated our ſelves, <hi>Atalanta</hi> in very good terms pray'd the audition of my foruntes. I then (not without fear of triping) told her at large this ſigment with many circumſtances and imbelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I will tell you in two or three words. I fain'd my ſelf to be niece to King <hi>Juba,</hi> though I was borne after his death. I told her a brother unto that King hearing of the voluntary death of <hi>Juba,</hi> and that he ſaw the hand of fortune reſolv'd to ſling that kingdome into the lap of the <hi>Romans,</hi> loath to follow the example of his brother and yet loath to become a ſlave to the <hi>Romane</hi> greatneſſe fled from that unfortunate place, and paſſing beyond the mountaine <hi>Atlas</hi> natures bound-mark to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, he found a

My father <hi>I</hi> told her dyed when I was very young and whom I could not remember, my mother (<hi>I</hi> feign'd) liv'd till I was fourteen years of age who in her life time had bred me in an extraordinary way of behaviour and civility contrary to the cuſtome of that Rude people. And that after her death my ſmall formoſity increaſing with my years made one of the chiefeſt in the kingdome deſire me, but that <hi>I,</hi> not enduring the great incivility and rude nature of thoſe <hi>Getulans,</hi> deſpiſed him, and forbad him ever to mention his ſute any more. But he (I told them) more enflam'd with Luſt than Love ſought one day having an opportunity) to have forc't me: a crime of the ſmalleſt nature amongſt them, and ſeldome puniſht but by laughter. However I made my force to reſiſt his violence and with helpe to preſerve my chaſtity, and that my complaints and teares to the King at laſt procur'd his baniſhment; which filling that wicked <hi>Getulan</hi> with enragement, lawes being of too ſmall force to curbe his Inſolency, watching his opportunity ſtab'd the King, and having a party ready, ſet the whole Kingdome into a combuſtion and flames of war. I ſaid that hearing the truth of the Kings death and fearing death leſſe than to fall into the hands of that parricide <hi>I</hi> fled with ſome few attendants towards the mount <hi>Atlas,</hi> but being purſued by him was there taken and every one of them that accompained me ſlain, my ſelf brought by him to the ſea and embarqed in a ſhip to returne with the more ſpeed to the Court, where his party was like to get the better. But the winde croſſing the intentions of the Tyrant drove him along the Coaſts of <hi>Mauritania</hi> as far as the ſtreight, where he was ſet upon by pyrats and ſlain, my ſelfe becoming their priſoner. <hi>I</hi> continued that the cheif of them conſidering me as his ſlave, appropriated me to himſelf, but perceiving ſome of his companions that would have had a ſhare in the prize he had reſerv'd to himſelf, and that he might with the more ſecurity force me to his ſenſuality he cauſed me with himſelf to be ſet on ſhore not far from that place, where he was about to force me to his will; but my ſckreeks and cryes calling ſome country men to my ayde, they opoſed him and that whilſt they fought for my defence, fearing the pyrate would get the better, <hi>I</hi> ran away towards ſome trees I ſaw for ſhelter and following a path that brought me to the river, <hi>I</hi> at laſt was ſurpriz'd by the night, where being weary with my flight and diſturbed with my diſtreſſes I was for'd to ſit down under the covert of thoſe trees, and that not having ſlept for along time by reaſon of my feares, I was ſuddenly ſurpriz'd with a ſound ſleep, where being awaked by the divine hand of <hi>Atalanta,</hi> I thought ſhe had been no other than the Chaſt <hi>Diana</hi> who had appear'd for my reſcue, but that now I underſtood it was <hi>Atalanta</hi> the unparrallel'd peere of courteſie and under whoſe tuition <hi>I</hi> hop'd to finde an end of my miſeries.

The ſun diſcovered all the perfections of that face wherein there was nothing but what was admirable, and paſt the skill of nature her ſelfe to mende. Her ornaments more rich than before I had ſeen her in, gave new ſplendor to her brightneſſe, or rather receiv'd brightneſſe from her ſplendor, which filling her all over with charmes gave a ſecond captivity to my before-enthralled heart. Whilſt my eyes fixed with a certain intentiveneſſe upon her, ſhe no leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the lineaments and make of my face. I had conſulted a more cleare mirror than the day before, and uſe beginning to make perfectneſſe I forgot not any thing that belonged to the pride of women. But perceiving her eyes reading I know not what charecters in my face, (I could not thinke what I might exhibit to that diſcernable eye) which through the viciſſitude of fear and ſhame, firſt diſrobed it of all its redneſſe, and then again return'd it with a new accretion.

                  <p>You will ſay that I had attaind to a great hight in my felicity and that the Gods themſelves had a finger in my proſperities: True indeed I receiv'd ſo great happineſſe and content in the pleaſing converſation of <hi>Atalanta,</hi> that I bleſt the time, though not the occaſion that I left my fathers houſe, whoſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible remembrances were now ſwallow'd up in my bleſſed felicities. In a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time the habit, and geſtures which I had aſſimulated, were grown ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and habituall as if I had accompanied them from my Infancie, ſo that I had no fear of diſcovering my ſelfe by any inaſſuety. Think not but Shame ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſet before me my muliebrity, and upbraided me with meanneſs of ſpirit, in leaving my more noble for ſo ignoble condition, and in accommodateing my ſelf to ſo great imbecillitie: And in repreſenting the future I found ſo many difficulties and unlikelyneſſes of effecting what I deſired that ſometimes I began to repent my deſignes. I fear'd I ſhould inſtead of her love acquire her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred when that ſhe ſhould know how greatly I had deceived and abuſ'd her. And to think of living allways in that condition without diſcovering my ſelf would have given adaequate pain to my pleaſures and have rackt me between two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries. But all objections both of honour and danger fled at her preſence, and then I found it as poſſible to think of leaving my condition as to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme my ſelf in verity, into the ſex I had aſſimulated, ſo great was the pleaſure I receiv'd in her company, and ſo great was the power of affectionate Love to hold me.</p>
                  <p>I remain'd ſeven weeks in this <hi>Sardanapalean</hi> condition, my flames ſtill encreaſing with my pleaſures, in which time <hi>Atalanta</hi> exhibited ſo perfect a friendſhip that it was impoſſible in the condition I was in to deſire more. To unite our amity in the greateſt nearneſs ſhe would have had me lain with her, but fearing to be overcome with ſo great temptation, <hi>I</hi> was allmoſt incivill to deny her! But by her impoſition we call'd one another ſiſters, and ſeldom but when we reſted were one minute out of the fight of each other. Sometimes though in the midſt of theſe pleaſures I ſhould evaporate ſighs, and in ſpight of all my delights the charctars of ſadneſſe would be wrot upon my face, which proceeded from the ſuppreſſion of my flames. <hi>Atalanta</hi> taking them to be the reflections of my former diſtreſſes, would apply ſuch pleaſing comforts and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapt ſuch endeared expreſſions that I could not but find ſolace in them, though the cauſe was far from that ſhe ſuppos'd: So that at the ſame time ſhe was both the object of my ſighs and Joy. Although that extreamly courteous one ſought to diſpell my ſadneſſe with her dear expreſſions and actions, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter all the ſolace ſhe was able, yet I perceiv'd that her heart was full of meſtitude, and that her dolor no ways decreaſed. She had not as yet communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the cauſe of it to me, and I perceiv'd ſhe did not deſire I ſhould take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, ſo that I would not exhibit my curioſity by asking it; Beſides I fear'd leaſt in knowing it I ſhould find my own ruin, and that Love preoccupied her mind, and was the cauſe of thoſe troubles: which beſt correſponded with that which I had ſecretly heard from her own mouth. But that I might allevate <hi>Atalanta</hi> I exhibited a greater alacrity than the conſideration of my penſive thoughts would willingly have admitted, I ſought all divertiſements, and made it my ſole pragma to adminiſter ſolace by diverſe recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Some times I would endeavour to divert her minde by the relation of divers ſtories and accidents, ſome fabulated and ſome true, and by many diſcourſes on ſeverall Subjects. Sometimes again I ſought to make her find ſome refreſhment in the delicate viridias of the gardens, and pleaſing places of the groves, and ſometimes again I would exerciſe her in running in the <hi>Hypaethryums</hi> and <hi>paradromes</hi> of the houſe, and when the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51633:71"/> imbrick <hi>Auster</hi> irrigated the ground in the <hi>Xyſtus.</hi> And when the calmneſs of the evening gave leave, we made uſe of her wonted ſolace upon the <hi>Tagus,</hi> where my ſelf often times uſ'd the oare for her tranſportation, and I never viſited the walke where in I firſt ſaw her without a benediction on the place. She was naturally very nimble, and ſhe allways would be very well pleaſ'd with any exerciſe I would challeng'd her to, wherein moſt times we did not exhibit our utmoſt induſtry or ſtrength out of a deſire to make our adverſary conqueror. One day having challeng'd her to run a race for ſome ſmall jewel or other (to ſuch innocent ſports had love made me to condeſcend) I let her win the prize by a voluntary retardation. But that curſory motion had dyed the cheeks of <hi>Atalanta</hi> of ſuch a ſcarlet hew, which rendred her ſo lovely that I could not but cry within my ſelf. Ah! murtherous <hi>Atalanta, Schaeneis</hi> wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only the <hi>Calydonian</hi> bore, and uſed her ſhafts againſt the ferocious beaſts, but you inſenſibly wound my heart with inumerable ſhafts which proced from thoſe lovely eyes, whoſe ſharpe <hi>Cuſpides</hi> hath ſplit the ſtony rock of my heart, and given iſſue to whole ſtreams of Love.

You are very pleaſant ſiſter (reply'd ſhe ſmiling) but I may thank your voluntary tardity that I am victoreſſe. In many ſuch innocently loveing ſtriveings we ſought to give each other victory, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying more in looſeing than in winning. And indeed <hi>I</hi> could not find greater content in the world than in the ſight and content of <hi>Atalanta,</hi> whom I had made the ſole object of deſires and ſole buſineſſe to ſerve. If ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent I thought my ſelf happy, and if I ſaw ſerenity in her face from the clouds of Sorrow <hi>I</hi> received more Joy than if half the world had been given me to poſſeſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atalanta</hi>'s governeſſe ſeeing the Love and care I bore to her, and that I made it my whole buſineſſe to divertize her, perceiving alſo that <hi>Atalanta</hi> bore me a great deal of Love, remitted her wholy to me, finding a great eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that burden which I had ſo willingly taken upon me, ſo that I was very often alone with her and had opportunity enough to diſcover my ſelf, had not a timerous reſpect continually baniſht thoſe Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and repreſented her juſt anger more terrible then death, ſo that I was forc'd to ſmother thoſe thoughts, and content my ſelf with the felicities I enjoy'd.</p>
                  <p>But whilſt my reſurging flames were ſuffocated with a continual depreſſion, they were as much ſufflated by a continual preſence, which gave me an intoller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inuſtion, &amp; made me do things almoſt enough to have diſcovered my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, had they not been ſo extreamly blinded by my habit. The continuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition of that deity gave innumerable incitements, and exuſcitated ſuch ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and lively flames, that after a while it was impoſible for me to exhibit the coldneſſe and indifferency I did at firſt, and not to excurr allmoſt into extravagancies in the reception of thoſe incomparable pleaſures <hi>Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanta</hi> gave. But ſeeing I could not acknowledg them, nor give my paſſion any vent by my mouth, I was fain to do it by my eyes and actions, and thereby ſilently to expreſſe that which I dar'd not to do with my tongue, oftentimes when we were alone, I ſhould behold her with ſo great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiveneſſe, and ſo avidiouſly devoure thoſe rarities, till I had quite loſt my ſelfe in thoſe Labyrinths of perfections, &amp; running from the contemplation of her auborne haire, to the intuition of her faire forehead, and from that to the perfect rainbowes of her face, under which two ſuns exhibited ſuch ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor that I was not able to behold them long without occecaton, then intuiting
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51633:72"/> her noſe which was raiſed to a perfect proportion, thence her mouth which was lovely and little, whoſe corals with a magnetick virtue uſ'd long to detaine my eyes, but at laſt gave leave to behold her dimpled chinn, and faire baſis of thoſe matchleſſe mirrors. Then aſcending back againe never wearie of thoſe pleaſing contemplations, nor findeing any way out of thoſe intricacies, till the bluſhes of her cheeks ſhewed me the way forth, and as it were brought me to my ſelfe againe; which ſometimes was accompanied with ſo many ingeminated ſuſpirations, that they ſeem'd Querimonies for my loſſe, and ſometimes it was accompanied with ſuch extravagances both of words and geſtures, that I have wondered that ſhe had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly ſeen my paſſion which ſometimes ſo ſhamed me, that I had little power left me to make excuſes. This growing frequent, ſhe thought it had been ſome indiſpoſition, and would have ſought for to have acquired ſomething for my health had I not over-perſwaded her to the contrary. I receiv'd a world of other felicities which gave daily and more ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations to my paſſion, and deſires of intire poſſeſſion of what I ſaw, ſometimes preſſing thoſe delicate and faire hands, and interweaving thoſe ſlender and ivory fingers with mine I ſhould carry them with ſuch paſſion to my lips, where I ſhould give them thouſands of ardent kiſſes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inflame thoſe lilyes with the continuall preſſure of my burning lips. Which to require reciprocally ſhe would returne ſome on my fore-head, cheeks and lips, which though I received with exceſſe of pleaſure and unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, yet was it much mitigated by the thoughts of the injurie I did her modeſty; for I could not but blame my ſelf that I did ſo egregiouſly abuſe one ſo courteous and affable, but love anſwered all ſcrupl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s, and forced me greedily to deſire thoſe ſweets. At other times when my officiouſneſſe hath made me helpe to pinne on thoſe veiles that obſcured that ſnow-ſurpaſſing whitneſſe, and religeouſly hid thoſe rarities from our profane eyes, I ſhould (tranſported at thoſe ſweetly riſeing tumours) baſiate thoſe faire orbes whoſe tender touches would have inflamed a ſoul compoſed all of water, judge you to what an extaſis theſe enjoyments drove me. Oftentimes alſo being in her chamber when ſhe hath beraken her ſelfe to repoſe, after her deveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I have beheld her only in her ſmock, which was too fine to hide any of thoſe attracting beauties from the eye of a Lover, but the rare ſimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that compoſure with all its beauties enough to have enamour'd the whole world, was perſpicable through that carbaſeous tegment. Oh? how I was faine to contract all the powers of my ſoul to retard the preſent motions of my deſires and paſſions at ſuch a ſight. By theſe continuall and forcible exſuſcitations of my flames you may judge with that difficulty I ſuppreſt them. And although I did digreſſe ſometimes by the too violent preſſure of my paſſion, my habit gave me ſecurity and freedome in thoſe digreſſions, and <hi>Atalanta</hi> took them all as tokens of my entire Love and affection.</p>
                  <p>In this manner full of deliciouſneſſe, and imparadiz'd in the fruition of theſe ſweets I ſpent many weeks, which ſeem'd but ſo many moments ſo inſeſibly had they paſt away.

                  <p>One day walking with <hi>Atalanta</hi> on the Tarraſſes of the houſe we ſpied a man on the other ſide of the river waving a white cloth of piece of ſilke upon a long ſtick about his head as if it were ſome ſignal for his admiſſion, as ſoon as I had ſhewn it her I perceived a hundred viciſſitudes of white and red in her face, with a generall diſturbance and tremour in all her limbs, at laſt fearing I had taken too much notice of her, ſhe took me by the hand and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51633:72"/> lead me down into the Court, and immediately giving order to ſome of her ſervants to fetch him over that was on the other ſide, It is one that muſt be admitted (ſaid ſhe to me) Ah! (continued ſhe ſoftly to her ſelfe, but ſo as I made a ſhift to hear her) fatal meſſenger either of life or death how great emotion has thy preſence wrought! Sighs began to follow in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance but that I perceived ſhe ſuppreſſed them with great pain for fear I ſhould take notice of her. By that time we had walked a few turns in the orange walke her maides had waſted him over, whom we ſaw approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us alone. <hi>Atalanta</hi> aſſoon as he had put one knee to the ground not permitting him to ſpeak caſt her faire armes about his neck and kiſſing his forehead had like to have ſwounded in his armes through the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance ſhe felt. At laſt leaving thoſe embraces, which began to exuſcitate envie and jelouſie in my breaſt, ſhe turn'd about to me her countenance bearing the badge of modeſty, I hope your goodneſſe (ſaid ſhe) hath not misinterpreted my action though indeed I have given you too great an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make you judge wronge of my pudicity, had I told you before who this is I might have hindred it. It is one of my maides who you thus ſee whoſe obſequiouſneſſe hath made her change the habit of her ſex to do me ſervice. Go (ſaies ſhe to the maid) diveſt your ſelfe and verifie what I have ſaid by your preſence. Siſter (ſaid I) though I wondered at your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet I ſuſpended my thoughts knowing your virtue would never permit you to tranſgreſſe the laws of modeſty, for I believ'd that you had ground for what you did. After a little time the maide, the cheife confident of <hi>Atalanta</hi> returned clothed in habilliments conſentanious to her ſex. Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome excuſe which was very willingly admitted of, I left them to their private conference. Two or three howers after having, me thought, been a long time weaned from her preſence the very comfort of my life, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to finde her, and after I had ſearcht all the walks, groves, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piares about the houſe, I found her in a virect which was encloſed with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miculous trees, very low, at the further end of that <hi>I</hi> let, cloſe by the river ſide. The maide <hi>I</hi> met at the entring into the place returning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the houſe: her eyes exhibited by their redneſſe that they had been paying tribute to grief in moiſt teares. But paſſing on without exchanging any words, <hi>I</hi> ſaw <hi>Atalanta,</hi> but ſo changed that I was amazed, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtopping the motion of my body, I ſtood as if I had beheld the head of <hi>Meduſa.</hi> She was laid upon the gramineous earth, her head leaning againſt a low cypres tree, her armes in a careleſſe manner caſt abroad, her eyes with a kind of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

After ſome time I approached her, &amp; endeavoured with all the words I was able to exprom out of a heart truly ſenſible of her grief, to give her ſome conſolation. But all that <hi>I</hi> could do or ſay gained nothing from her but abundance of teares and ſighs, that I was very troubleſome to her, griefe having a kinde of pleaſure in it, and thinks it ſelfe wrong'd by the interruptions of any. When <hi>I</hi> ſaw I could give her no allevament by my words, I ſat me down oppoſite to her and looking upon her with eyes ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth tears <hi>I</hi> accompanied her in her lacrymations. When ſhe lookt upon me and ſaw the torrents, than ran over the ſwellings of my cheeks and trickled to the ground (like another <hi>Alpheus</hi> running after his <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſa</hi>) ſhaking her head ſhe wept the more, and her teares ſtill exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting mine we made a torrent betwixt us of our mingled waters tears ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting tears, and the ſadneſſe of the one ſtill continuing the ſadneſſe of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51633:73"/> other, that we ſate like two <hi>Niobes</hi> drowning our cheeks with continuall tears.</p>
                  <p>In this poſture we were found by her governeſſe, who together with her maid came to endeavour to draw her out of her great ſorrow, and by her grave counſel to abſterge her tears, what with the power ſhe had over her, and with the ſound ſpeeches ſhe uſed ſhe ſomething mitigated the efluence of thoſe argenteous currents, and at laſt cauſed her to leave that place, when we werein her chamber, perceiving that ſhe deſired privacie I left her with little leſſe meſtitude than her ſelf, finding my ſelf interreſted in her grief, and troubled for being ignorant of the cauſe. The next day I viſited her, and I found that grief had not altogether ſo powerful an opperation upon her, but that ſhe had power now to ask pardon for the trouble ſhe had put me to the day before, and for the little regard ſhe had of my conſolations. <hi>I</hi> proceeded to comfort her all I might; and though <hi>I</hi> knew not the occaſion of her plangor yet ſpeaking generally of grief <hi>I</hi> told her, that teares were but a vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and tormenting our ſelves for things irrecoverable, paſt, and done, was but a weakneſſe, and that it was a paſſion whoſe excurſions ought to be ſtopped and moderated, and that it might be effected by a reſignation of our wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Such other counſell I adminiſtred, which my ſelf was not able to follow; but ſhe anſwered me not but with abundance of ſuſpirations, thereby teſtifying that her griefe proceeded from more than common cauſes, and that there was ſomething extraordinary in it. The ſpace of a whole week ſhe continued in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner though not with that exceſſe as at firſt, yet growing more upon her and takeing at laſt root it became the more dangerous. When I ſaw that I expected in vain when ſhe would tell me the cauſe of her trouble, and that with all the art I could uſe I gave her very little comfort, I was ſo troubled that my looks exhibited how grear a ſhare I bore in her ſorrow. One day <hi>Atalanta</hi> having given me the ſlip to feaſt her <hi>Melancholy</hi> thoughts with funebrous meditations I at laſt found her in a ſolitary place amongſt the taxeous ſhades, compaſſed about with thoſe ſepulchrall trees, mingled with the fruitleſſe Cipreſſe. She had newly began to bedew the fair roſes of her cheeks with the moſt pertious liquor of her eyes, and thoſe pearl-bearing ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets ſpringing from the marvellously limpid fonticules ebbed &amp; flow'd accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the variable tyde of ſorrowful thoughts. My preſence gave ſome check to their outflowing, and made her wipe away thoſe moiſt characters of her grief with her <hi>ricula;</hi> but their impreſſions on my heart could not ſo ſoon be abſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. I ran to her with my wonted confidence, and flinging my ſelf on the graſs by her I took her fair hands, and giving them many ſuaviations, and bedewing I at laſt broke forth my reſentments thus. Ah ſiſter <hi>Atalanta,</hi> (my teares accommpanying my words) have you not ſo much confidence in my fidelity to entruſt me with the cauſe of this dolor? how can I live and behold you in continuall mourning and give no comfort? and how can I adminiſter conſolation, correſpondent to your griefe, and be ignorant of the cauſe of it! either let me dye, or elſe not live ſo great a ſtranger to your thoughts!

When ſhe had cleared the paſſage for her words with a thouſand heart-labouring ſighs, her teares alſo ſuffering a new reflux ſhe ſaid. Dear <hi>Sabane!</hi> It is not thy fidelity that I miſtruſt, nor any other conſideration but ſhame hath hindered me from imparting the knowledge of it to thee, and fear that in knowing it you will for ever deteſt me. Oh (replyed I ſuddenly) let not ſuch cogitations prove obſtacles to my deſires, for thoſe bonds wherewith my amitie is bound are to be ſolved by no conſideration but death. I ſee you know not the depth of my affection, for if you did you would not have Judged ſo wrongfully of me. It is impoſſible for you <hi>Sabane</hi> to help me in the leaſt (ſaid ſhe again) for if you knew it you would not (queſtionleſſe) ſtop my teares, but ſay all my dayes will be too too little for my penitency, and were my dayes lengthned to years, and ſhould every day ſhed rivers of teares, they would be all too little to make ſatisfaction for my fault. Nothing hinders me but the ſhame <hi>I</hi> know will acrue thereby, and I know not how to confeſſe my crime and outlive my ſhame. Here giving way to ſome ſighs ſhe went on. Ah ſiſter if I ſhould not tell you ere, long my crime would be too perſpicable and then <hi>I</hi> muſt be forced to let you know it when I can no longer hide it.

I knew not how to explicate her words, but <hi>I</hi> found that they cauſed an extreame emotion in me, which was a true preſage of that which was to happen.

                  <p>Such like complaints as theſe were continually emitted by me, Love and hatred wracking me miſerably, ſometimes I deteſted my love, by and by blamed my ſelfe for deteſting, ſometimes <hi>I</hi> thought to depart, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine I found it impoſſible, for I no ſooner beheld <hi>Atalanta</hi> but all my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments ceaſed and I found that my chaines were nothing looſned with the knowledge of her crime, her eyes ſtill tranſpierced me, and my flames burnt as ardent as ever. However a week paſſed away in which I dayly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented my misfortune in hers, and with that exceſſe of trouble which could not be concealed that they wondred at the intereſt I took in hers. She poor ſoul dared ſcarcely to behold me, ſo much ſhame was ſeted in her eyes, which made her with an humble dejection, project them on the earth, her countenance being cloathed with ſo much ſorrow, and her penitentiall teares were ſo many, that they were ſtrong motives for the taking away all ill opinons of her, and to move one rather to pity and compaſſion, than to any up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braidings, or to the increaſing of her griefe, which was ſo exceſſive. Ah! <hi>Sabane</hi> (would ſhe ſometimes ſay) canſt thou now blame my teares? doth not my crime deſerve greater penances? is it poſſible that thou do'ſt not deteſt me, doe not you think me worthy of death, and unworthy of your company and friendſhip! Oh, Gods how unjuſtly ye prolong my Life! no no it is juſt, that thereby ye prolong my miſery. But may I not violate your reſtraining Lawes, and give my ſelfe liberty by a voluntary expiration, as well as I have violated thoſe of chaſtity! Speake <hi>Sabane</hi> by what death ſhall I redeem my honour? Alas it is now too late, I cannot break the chains of life but I muſt murther the innocent. In this manner ſhe would run on, whilſt my teares kept pace with her words, both in conſideration of her griefe and my misfortune! All the comfort I could adminiſter was too weake to ſtop her complaints, or the effluence of her Chriſtal fountaines, which with a kind of miracle carryed flames in the midſt of thoſe waters? Sorrow it ſelf giving a kinde of I know not what luſtre to her beauty, and her teare bedewed countenance ſpake ſo eloquently and pathetically, that it made me (forgetting my ſelf) to run out into ſuch fury againſt our ſex devow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be revenged with my own hands on him that had cauſ'd that fair on ſuch dolor, and had done her ſuch deſpight. For that end, deſiring her to let me know who it was, I beſeech'd her to give me leave to let him feel the fury of my ſo juſt reſentment. To give ſatisfaction to my deſires, and that I might ſee ſhe would withold nothing from me, ſhe commanded her maide, and chiefeſt confident, to give me a brief relation of her fortune, who in obedience to her commands gave me the relation in theſe termes.</p>
                  <p>Who would give any audition to the oathes, to the vowes, and invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of men? Who would believe them when they ſwear, who would pity them when they ſeem to groan themſelves to death? And who would grant them the leaſt favour before <hi>Hymen</hi> tye the indiviſſible bond of matremony? when they are ſo wicked, ſo deceitfull, ſo inſtable, ſuch egregious Impoſters, delighting to deceive our weaker ſex, and when they have vitiated our honours, leave us to reap the fruit of ſhame and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny.</p>
                  <p>My Lady I confeſs hath exhibited the weakneſs of our ſex, and ſhown how eaſie our natures are to be beguil'd, who for wit and judgement in ſo tender years, for beauty in ſo ſpringing a bloſſom, and for all the other endowments of nature is not to be parallel'd in all <hi>Iberia,</hi> yet hath been
<pb facs="tcp:51633:75"/> beguil'd by the moſt falſe and abominable among men, and hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd by the deceitfulneſs of Love, and the ſuſceptibleneſs of her own nature into the arms of folly. But to tell you briefly how, and by whom this misfortune happen'd, know; My Lord Prince of the <hi>Turditanes</hi> and father to the Princeſſe <hi>Atalanta</hi> being forced by the chances of war, and fortune to vail his Crown to that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> took up his reſidence in the pleaſant City of <hi>Hyſpalis,</hi> and under the tuition of thoſe generous enemies liv'd with the ſame ſecurity as amongſt friends. I was then given to <hi>Atalanta</hi> to be her conſort and her ſervant, my duty and my love bound me indiviſibly to her intereſts, and from that time ſhe made me her Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and Repoſitory of her ſecrets. For beauty begining to break forth through the clouds of her infancy, and that fair and decorous bud begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to expand it ſelf in the bloſſom of riper years, perſtring'd the eyes of many a warlike <hi>Roman,</hi> and made them languiſh with deſire to crop ſo fair a Roſe. Every day added new luſtre to her eyes, and every week plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed freſh roſes in her cheeks. Each hour brought new captiv'd hearts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chain'd to render adoration at her ſhrine, and the <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tialists,</hi> receiving the fire of their courage from that of her eyes, confeſt that the power of <hi>Venus</hi> was far greater than that of <hi>Mars.</hi> Whilſt thus ſhe encreaſed the glory of the City, by the ſame of her beauty, and whilſt ſhe had as many Lovers and Adorers as Spectators, Love (ſeeing her inexorable to all) was hatching a man to plague her for her cruelty. She was now in the prime of her beauty, her fair flower fully blown, and in its chiefeſt luſtre, when the moſt perfidious vagabond <hi>Marcipſius</hi> (being expulſed <hi>Affrica</hi> arriv'd in the <hi>Amaene</hi> City <hi>Hiſpalis.</hi> To ſee <hi>Attalanta</hi> at that time, and not to love her, was impoſſible. Fame made <hi>Marcipſius</hi> covet the ſight of <hi>Atalanta,</hi> which intuition ſet that wicked one all on fire, he being the tinder of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,</hi> and inflam'd him with I know not what kind of luſtfull and furious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</p>
                  <p>I ſat (ſaid <hi>Lonoxia</hi> to <hi>Euripedes</hi> altering his tone) immovable at theſe words, but the immotions within exhibited themſelves ſo perſpicuouſly in my face, that the Confident of <hi>Atalanta</hi> might have ſeen them, had ſhe not been ſo intentive upon her relation. I had much ado to with-hold from crying out when <hi>I</hi> heard this ſecond ſurcharge of my misfortunes, for I fear'd whither 'twould tend, but amazement, fear and trembling ty'd my lips, and I heard her without interruption continue her diſcourſe thus.</p>
                  <p>That imperious fire raging in the breaſt of this ſtranger, he ſought for nothing but to allay its heat by the waters of fruition, for the gaining of which he rely'd more on his facundity, and outward graces of his body, than on any vertues that accompanied him. Its pity that golden boxes enchac'd with precious ſtones ſhould be the Conſervers of poyſon; but it is more pity that men adorned with all the outward gifts and embelliſhments of nature ſhould be poſſeſſ'd with ſouls implete with <hi>Stygian</hi> vices, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt with incarnate wicked <hi>Daemons.</hi> This <hi>Marcipſius</hi> ſoon out-went all his Corrivals, and gaining the heart of <hi>Atalanta's</hi> father with a wondrous dexterity, he admitted him to lodge in his pallace when he knew he was the Nephew of King <hi>Bogadus,</hi> and uſing him with all the reſpect his birth oblig'd him to, he gave him convenience and opportunity (though unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly) to vitiate his own daughter. Never was there a more indulgent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Atalanta</hi> being the comfort of his age, and her mother and ſiſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, ſo that he gave her all the liberty ſhe could deſire, believing her diſcreet and wiſe. She began now to looſe her ſelf in <hi>Marcipſius,</hi> and abated that pudicit ſeverity which ſhe had ſhewn to all others. She lent ſome ear to his flatteries, and without check gave him leave to court her. In a word, ſhe began to love him, and to feel the tyranny of that curſed caitiffe <hi>Cupid.</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:51633:75"/> The firſt day that ſhe ſaw him ended her happineſs, and began her miſery. On the other ſide that caitiffe <hi>Marcipſius</hi> play'd his part ſo cunningly, that neither <hi>Atalanta</hi>'s father, nor ſhe her ſelf could perceive, that he lov'd her, or rather had a deſire to abuſe her. He had a peculiar way of ſpeaking very gracefull and taking, whereby he would charm ears to his diſcourſe, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other natural endowments (which were all obſcur'd by his vices) he was poſſeſt. In a ſhort time he had wholly overcome that ſevere heart of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talanta's,</hi> and ſubjected it under the yoak of his Tyranny, before ſhe knew from him that he ſigh'd only for her ſake: At laſt believing by the affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of my Lady that his ſuit would not be moleſtious, he very ſecretly, but with wonderfull paſſion, made it known, vowing (with wonderfull exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations to light upon him if he broke them) to live only for her ſervice, and to reſign at her feet his life and liberty. It is more hard to diſſemble our joy than any other paſsion, it being apt to exhibit it ſelf with a ſprightlineſs in our eyes; my Lady yet ſo much maſtered her ſelf, that although ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired nothing more, ſhe ſeem'd very cold to his addreſſes, and ſhewed part of her natural ſeverity, contrary to the motions of timorous Love: But yet ſhe did not abſolutely forbid him the addreſsing himſelf any more in thoſe terms, if ſhe had I doubt he would not have credited her tongue to run parallel with her heart. Not to exaggerate theſe works of repentance in ſumme he nothing abaſhed at this firſt redargution continued his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations with ſuch paſſion, that it was no eaſie matter for <hi>Atalanta</hi> to withſtand the letting him know ſhe accepted of his ſervices, conſidering how ſhe lov'd him. Almoſt a whole year expired before ſhe let him underſtand that ſhe bore him any affection, or that his ſervices were accepted, in which time he ſhew'd the greateſt paſsion and obſequiouſneſs that could be imagined. At laſt <hi>Atalanta</hi> believing that his fidelity and his love could not have ended but with his life, gave him that happineſs of knowing her mind when he leaſt expected it, and in letting him underſtand that his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and devoyrs were acceptable to her when he almoſt deſpaired of it. If I ſhould recount the oaths, the vowes and the <hi>Stygian</hi> atteſtations that he made at that time, with the horrid and <hi>Erebous</hi> execrations he invok'd if he prov'd perfidious, it would make you tremble to think that any man ſhould be guilty of ſuch perjurations and curſes. For our parts we thought it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to illude the gods, or that after thoſe vowes and oathes he could violate them for fear of being puniſht with their thunders, ſo that we gave the more truſt to his words, and innocent <hi>Atalanta,</hi> as it were rendred her ſelf up to him. Who would think that wicked men ſhould take upon them the habit of vertue, the better and more ſecurely to act their impieties, and to attain their vicious deſires? O flagitious <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipſius,</hi> could'ſt not ſee thy happineſs! was it not enough for the deſire of the whole world to do thee homage, but that thou muſt ſeek to vitiate and deſile ſo precious a ſoul! Oh baſe twy-faced Hypocrite! ſo to diſſemble the actions of vice under thoſe illuſtrious ones of vertue! Ah Madam <hi>Sabane</hi> never was there a greater diſſimulator breathing, nor one who ſo often vow'd what he never intended: <hi>I</hi> cannot make uſe of words too bad for ſo impious a wretch, the very double-fac'd diſſembler that is, and very abſtract of wickedneſs. We had time enough to try his vertue, and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother year which for the moſt part he ſpent in the company of <hi>Atalanta,</hi> (largely recompenſing her father with many Princely gifts) he ſeem'd to continue his love with ſo much ardency and obſequiouſneſs, that it was impoſſible for us ever to expect the leaſt change. My Lady, if it be not a crime to confeſs it, lov'd him intirely, and granted him all in honeſty he could requeſt, ſo that at laſt, preſſed by his continual prayers, and judging him worthy of what he deſired, in my preſence ſhe deſponded her ſelf to him,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51633:76"/> and promiſed him to confirm it by the <hi>Hymenaean</hi> pact ſo ſoon as he could diſpoſe her father to it. He ſeem'd to deſire nothing more, and exhibited all the Symptoms of joy a man could be capable of. He a thouſand times confeſt his own unworthineſs, and her goodneſs, with the great felicity and content ſo free a promiſe gave him. This nefarious man harbouring nought but deſires to ſcelerate innocent and beguiled <hi>Atalanta,</hi> never ſought to ask her of her father, but plainly ſeeing the love ſhe bore him, began with wonderfull adulation to gain favours from her hands, and from trifles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded till he had ſubverted the fortreſs of her chaſtity. From leaving the empreſſes of his lips upon her hands, he gain'd them off her lips, and then her boſome, till at length ſhe had rendred her ſelf too weak to withſtand his flattering incitements. And having ſuch opportunities his love never ſuſpected by <hi>Atalanta's</hi> father, her love making her forget the thoughts of her honour, believing his paſſion, and crediting his vows, being as it were confident he would never forſake her, yielded a complacency to his paſſion, and loſt her virginian gem between the arms of that Stuprator. Madam, my Lady ſtrictly charg'd me not to extenuate her crime, but to exhibit to you the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of her weakneſs, but I hope you will conſider that the great love ſhe bore to that deteſtable one, confiding in his oaths and vowes, with the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible allurements and incitments he proſecuted her with, were ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to the ſubverſion of her feminine reſiſtance. I hope your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration will rimate ſome idoneous cauſation for her frailty, and ſaply my weakneſs in that particular. Nevertheleſs if your rigorous vertue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the exſuſcitation of your pity, to help it, conſider with how many tears, with how much dolor, with how much grief, and with how much pain ſhe hath endeavoured not to expiate, but to bewail her folly, and to have depriv'd the earth of that happineſs of bearing one ſo amiable, and you'l confeſs that her miſerie hath ſatisfied for her fault, and that vertue when ſhe did it was not loſt but hid. But now I'le tell you this wicked <hi>Marcipſius</hi>'s perfidy; When he had ſufficiently abuſed my dear Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs, and that he had ſatiated himſelf, and gain'd the end of his long ſuite, on a ſudden he pretended letters from his father, and that there was a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his returning if ever he hop'd to attain the Crown he ambitioned. I imagin the conſternation this put <hi>Atalanta</hi> into, were all the <hi>Muſes</hi> conjoyn'd to repreſent the paſſion ſhe was in, and the grief ſhe exhibited, they could not be able to expreſs the third part of it. It is as much as I can ſay that ſhe was ſeiz'd with a general ſtupor and aſtoniſhment, inſomuch that I fear'd I ſhould never bring her to her ſelf again: That ſcelerous wretch ſtanding by impaſſible, <hi>I</hi> thought ſhe would have died in my arms, had he not ingemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated his vows for his ſudden return, at which time he would obtain her fathers leave for her marriage. But her grief was ſo violent that theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes could hardly give any relaxation to it, a ſad <hi>Omen</hi> and ſure preſage of his perfidiouſneſs and her miſeries. Cruel heart not to be mollified with thoſe tears able to have penetrated the lapidian rocks! No, he with his ſpecious pretences and fair promiſes did as it were force himſelf from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her arms, ſo that at laſt he left her but in a condition far more likely to crave a paſſage of the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He took his leave alſo of <hi>Atalanta</hi>'s father with the ſame ſpecious pretences and promiſes of returning, the laſt words that I ſpake to him were to be mindfull of that condition wherein he left <hi>Atalanta,</hi> and that he ſhould not diſcover her diſhonour by his long moration in <hi>Affrica.</hi> He was very profuſe of his oaths, and made no conſcience to delude both gods and men by an emitting thouſands that he never had intention to perform. This to be deteſted <hi>Marcipſius</hi> being gone, all that I was able to ſay or do to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talanta</hi> was too little to give her one minutes reſt, for <hi>Althea</hi> opening her

What (ſaid ſhe to me whilſt I ſtrove to hinder her deſign againſt her ſelf) will you diſoblige me now in this laſt exigent? have <hi>I</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted your fidelity hitherto, and will you not prove obedient and faithfull to the end? Ah! let me not out-live my crime. Seeſt thou not that I am expoſed to the ſhame and ignominy of the world? Let me die! ah let me die! Think not that thou canſt reſtrain me long; neither think that thou doſt me any ſavour; for thou doſt but detain me in torment and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
                  <p>Ah tell my father my crime when I have expired; and beg; ah beg! in my name his pardon for contaminating his blood, but let him ſee that <hi>I</hi> have ſpirit enough to revenge it on my degenerating carcaſe; and that I abhor my ſelf for it. Ah Madam (wept I forth) you ſhall never have cauſe to complain of my infidelity, but I cannot obey theſe too too rigorous commands. I will make ſatisfaction hereafter for my diſobedience by my own puniſhment. Pardon me, pardon me, Madam, (cryed I out when I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to force the weapon from her hand, ſeeing my words not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent enough) if my audacity exhibit it ſelf in the room of my woonted reſpect. But ſhe darting an angry look upon me quailed my boldneſs; yet ſeeing ſhe perſiſted, <hi>I</hi> rent open my boſome, and preſented her my naked breaſt, with a voice more vehement than ordinary. Ah cruel one (cry'd <hi>I</hi> out) if you are reſolved to die, at leaſt grant me the favour of not ſeeing it; here, here peirce this breaſt, the only obſtacle to your deſign, for think not that I will permit you to offer violence to your ſelf whilſt I live, ſend me firſt out of the world, and then follow if you are ſo reſolved. No (replyed ſhe feebly) <hi>I</hi>'le ſpare thee, and lifting up her head at that inſtant, ſhe ſought to have plung'd the bodkin into her breaſt, but her ſafety making me nimble, and deſpiſing all danger, I clapt my arm upon her breaſt, and received the ſtroke which ran a good depth therein. I took the blow very patiently; for ſmiling a little, Ah! <hi>I</hi> have prevented that fatal ſtroke, ſtrike as many more ſuch as you pleaſe: Whilſt I ſpake, the blood circulated my arm, and running down on the flore, began to make <hi>Meandres</hi> under our feet.</p>
                  <p>Dear <hi>Atalanta</hi> beholding what ſhe had done, had not power to pull the bodkin out of my arm, which <hi>I</hi> held extended, and lookt upon it as the beſt act it had ever done, glorying in that badge which it had acquired (though unwittingly on her part) from the hands of my dear Lady.

                  <p>At laſt through the favour of the Gods in bleſſing the <hi>Aeſculapian</hi> means ſhe recovered, though ſome months were firſt paſt over, in all which time we heard nothing from that ſinfull perjuror and cauſer of our miſeries: The thought of which often afflicted poor <hi>Atalanta</hi> in ſo much that I feared a relapſe. Her governeſſe that good old gentle-woman wondring that her eyes were oftentimes ſwoln with griefe and her face looking pale and wann, would often object to her, that griefe was the greateſt promoter of her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers: but ſhe could not wreſt the truth from her till at laſt accedentally it was thus diſcovered, <hi>Atalanta</hi> emitting a flood of teares was entred into moſt ſad complaints of the injury of <hi>Marcipſius,</hi> and blaming me for the retardation of her death, I feared her violences would have led her into new extravagancies. I had caſt my ſelfe upon my knees to give her all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation I could, and with my teares and prayers ſought to allay her diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. Her nurſe ſuddenly ſurprizing us in this poſture, and hearing ſome words that I ſpeak to comfort her, would be no longer denyed the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that which ſhe was too certaine afflicted <hi>Atalanta.</hi> For what reaſon (ſaid ſhe) doe you thus exclude me the knowledge of your grief? why muſt <hi>I</hi> be ignorant of the cauſe of it? have you not confidence enough in me to entruſt me with your ſecrets? am I not in the place of a mother? yea and my affections ſupply the place of maternall intereſt as well as my outward appearance. The love I beare you is able to overſhadow all faults, and to adminiſter helpe to your diſtreſſes by the experience of my longaevity. <hi>Atalanta</hi> could now no longer hide it from her, nor could ſhe know how to declare it, her teares ſupplying the place of Speech. At laſt terging the fluid pearls that ſlid from thoſe two <hi>Magaritiferous</hi> founts ſhe gave me a permiſſion to let her governeſſe know the ſad cauſe of her dolor. When I had performed my relation ſhe well ſaw that <hi>Atalanta's</hi> condition would not admit of any chideing, but that comforts and relaxations were more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for her, ſhe wiſely made uſe, of her beſt oratory to comfort her, and omitted her ſeverity, which would have augmented her dolor, and made her have ſunke under the burden of it. And truly I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded but for the continuall perſwaſions, and comforts of that wiſe <hi>Lady</hi> ſhe had not grac't this place with her preſence, at this time, but would have been reſident in the <hi>Elyſian</hi> fields. To ſatisfie our ſelves conerning <hi>Marcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> we ſent one into <hi>Affrick</hi> to know what was become of him. The meſſenger return'd with certaine intelligence that he was not returned thither and that his father had not heard of him ſince his departure from <hi>Affrica.</hi> This was a renewing to <hi>Atalanta</hi>'s ſorrows ſo perſpicuably to behold his deception and falſities.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:51633:77"/>
                  <p> The fourth month was now come ſince the departure of unworthy <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipſius,</hi> and the growing pledge of his perfideouſneſſe receiving Life from the influence of genial ſtarrs, gave notiſe by its lively moving to <hi>Atalanta</hi> that ſhe was likely to become the mother of ſome fair infant. The old lady carefull of her honour and to prevent the ignominy that might accrew by the appearing tumour of her belly; obtain'd permiſſion of her father to change the aire for her healths ſake.</p>
                  <p>He would have accompanied her but the lady with many reaſons perſwaded him to the Contrary, promiſing in little time to bring her from her melancholy, and to reſtore her to her perfect health. He knowing the wiſdome and diſcretion of her Governeſſe, and hopeing to ſee the clouded browes of <hi>Atalanta</hi> reclear'd, and to poſſeſſe their former luſtre, gave way to this ſeparation and aſſigneing this place, (which the <hi>Romans</hi> had left him with many others) for our retirement, we paſſed hither with theſe few ſervants, avoyding all publike inviſagements, await<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time when ſhe ſhall disburden (that which ſhe termes) her ſhame.</p>
                  <p>We had been but few weeks in this place ſo commodious for our ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo delectable for the tyred ſenſes of <hi>Atalanta,</hi> but that her grief rather encreaſing than diminiſhing made us allmoſt diſpair of her recovery. Nevertheleſſe ſhe was ſo much taken with the place that ſhe reſolved never to leave it, finding ſo much convenience for her melancholy. There was nothing that wit could produce or the power of Love imagine that we did not make tryall of for her diverſion. For my part when I heard her exclame againſt her ſelf; and with moſt bitter remonſtrances end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eavour to make her ſelf odible; I on the contrary, and more juſtlie, ſpit out the anger I had conceiv'd againſt that wretch in dire execrations for his perfidie, who was the cauſe of all her miſery. O ſtrange power of Love! O wronged innocency! do you think ſhe could hear the leaſt reproach utter'd againſt him? no alas! ſhe had not lov'd him ſo poorly as to hate him for his baſeneſſe. She would not permit me to ſpeake againſt him but even ſought with many excuſes to juſtify his breach of promiſe. Blame him not (would ſhe ſay) let all reproaches be lay'd upon me, and it might in juſtice be ſo, account me as the looſeſt wretch that lives, as the moſt diſpicable thing that breaths, as the inſulſeſt animall voy'd of reaſon, wit, or Judgment, ſo to part with my honour, ſo to obſcure my virtue. But blame not I ſay <hi>Marcipſius,</hi> it may be he is not living, how know we but that the ſeas have prov'd his grave? how know we but that his Ghoſt ſilently reproaches us for thus falſly accuſeing him? it may be fetters detaine him, and who knows but he dyes a thouſand times a day for fear <hi>I</hi> ſhould reproach him for his ſtay? he is not return'd, why then ſhould we conceive thus ill of him? he hath not yet been in <hi>Africa,</hi> why then ſhould we not thinke that either death, bonds, wounds, impriſonment, or ſome ſuch accident detaines him, and deprives us of the happineſſe of ſeeing him? Ah! madam (I'de anſwer) how good are you to this criminall, but I fear you wrong the laws of charity, I rather thinke that haveing forgotten you, or at leaſt remembting you with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion he is endeavouring to beguile ſome other; and to betray ſome ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent creature with his facinating looks. Let it be ſo then (ſhe'd reply faintly) nevertheleſſe ſpeak not againſt him, <hi>I</hi> cannot endure it, 'cauſe <hi>I</hi> love him, would I had one <hi>I</hi> could entruſt, I would ſend once more into <hi>Africa,</hi> it may be he may be return'd by this. Why madam (ſaid <hi>I</hi>) have you loſt the confidence you were wont to repoſe in me? can you ſay you want a confident whilſt I am with you. No dear one (ſaid ſhe) but thou art not fit for ſuch a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, <hi>I</hi> ment one of the robuſter ſex, who might have ſought him out where ever he is, and ſatisfy my doubting minde whether <hi>I</hi> have accuſ'd him wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or no. My Love is not ſo ſmall madam (ſaid <hi>I</hi>) but that I could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

At laſt I gain'd her conſent to let me take the voyage upon me, and inveſting my ſelf with thoſe viril garments you ſaw me in I croſſed over to <hi>Mauritania</hi> leaving her big with the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the iſſue of my voyage.

Theſe things being tragicall, yet not any thing concerning me I reſented nothing but on <hi>Marcipſius</hi> being there. The next day I went to ſpeake with him and gaining at length private audience I ask'd him if he had forget me: and when <hi>I</hi> ſaw he did not know me, I pull'd out a letter which I had received from <hi>Atalanta</hi> and gave him. After he had read it, with paſſion little enough. Is it poſible (ſaid that curſed wretch) that ſhe ſhould complaine on me? attend (ſaid he to me) to morrow and I will return an anſwer to your lady's letter. My eyes at theſe words flam'd with indignation, and my heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As little notice as he took on me he knew me well enough, for my lady had in her letter given him notiſe that it was I preſented him with the letter, and knowing this, I was out of meaſure enraged, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out venting on word I returned, giveing him notice I would wait on him according to his appoyntment. Hardly ſleeping all night for the paſſion the carriage of that devill, (for he deſerves not the title of humane) had put me in; the next day I went to enquire for him, when his ſervants told me that he was departed without the notice of any, preſently after I had left him.</p>
                  <p>At this news I was ſo diſturb'd that they Judg'd by my actions that I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, I ſtampt, tore my hair, my face and clothes, and call'd him a thouſand traitours. But at laſt I vow'd ne'r to return to <hi>Atalanta</hi> till <hi>I</hi> had found this traitour out, and vented my reproaches to his face. Guided by fury and rage I left the city, being aſſured by divers that ſaw him leave it, that he was gone and with moſt diligent perveſtigations I ſpent five or ſix weeks in vaine, viſiting all the cheifeſt places in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and inquireing after him with unweariable paines, till at leſt I heard of him in the city of <hi>Tingis.</hi> Reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give him no opportunity to eſcape I awaited a time till I ſpied him without the City walking under the ſhade of ſome trees not far from the palace wall of King <hi>Bogadus.</hi> After a little while I perceiv'd him to draw a kind of tablet out of his pocket on which he buſied himſelfe with great inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſſe, ſo that I had the opportunity to come behind him and ſpied the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies of ſome lady I knew not. But ſuddenly takeing hold on him. Traitor (ſaid <hi>I</hi>) you ſhall not eaſily eſcape my reproaches now, for what reaſon haſt thou thus abuſed me? He turn'd haſtily about and perceiving it was I, I ſaw he was amazed, but ſtrugling with me ſought to be gone. My ſmall ſtrength at that time ſo engag'd him that he could not eaſily diſentangle himſelf, from my armes and leggs. Stay traitor (ſaid I) ſtay and hear what I have to ſay: then <hi>I</hi> ask'd him again whether he had forgot his vowes and oaths, and why he had abuſed <hi>Atalanta:</hi> See here (anſwered that ungratious and boldly impudent one, holding to me the tablet which he held in his hand) the cauſe of my change; this beauty hath a crown to give as well as pleaſure. Ah vile monſter!

I was nothing ſolicitous of my life being enraged at his wickedneſſe ſo that I ſtopt not for his threats but continued calling him, traitor, ſtuprator and what ever rage firſt exhibited. He made a thruſt or two at me, although he knew I had no weapon, nor was of a ſex to contend with him, but I ſhifted well enough; and to plague him the more I ran towards the Lady crying beware of this villaine, this facinorous <hi>Marcipſius,</hi> that trator, that violator of faith, and honeſty, that corruptor and vitiator of virgins.</p>
                  <p>The wicked <hi>Marcipſius</hi> cried out to them; have a care of that mad man, and running with his ſword drawne made as if he had defended them, till they were got within the poſterne, when he following them left me ſtill craving the Gods to puniſh him for his Scelerity. After I had wearied my ſelf with exclaiming I return'd into the city, and embarquing for <hi>Spain</hi> I at laſt (after ſome retardation by the winds) got ſafe to this place, where I gave my fair miſtreſſe this ſad relation, which was the cauſe of that heavy dolor you found her in when your ſympathizing tears mixt with hers.

                     <hi>Atalanta</hi>'s confident thus ended her diſcourſe, and caſting her eye upon me to expect thoſe words which I ought to have expreſſ'd againſt ſo egregious a perfidy; ſhe ſaw that I ſat like an image wherein neither life nor ſoul had any reſidence. She ſpake to me, ſhe toucht me, ſhe pull'd me, but I neither hear'd, nor felt, for indeed grief, ſo much augementd by the knowledg that I muſt looſe the ſovereign of my ſoul, cauſ'd through my brothers wickedneſſe, had taken away the uſe of all my ſenſes, and left me altogether impaſſible. If be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could have lov'd her after her pollution, I could not think now of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning her, after I knew it was my own brothers defilement. Grief and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazedneſs held me a long time in this benummedneſs, which the maid ſeing &amp; fearing ſome ſudden ſickneſſe, ſcreem'd out, being affrighted at my paleneſſe. <hi>Atalanta</hi> came thither before I had recovered my ſelfe from that kind of <hi>Syncopy.</hi> But in coming to my ſelf, ah cur'ſt traitor! ſigh'd I out: ah in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable ruin of my Life! <hi>Atalanta</hi> wonder'd at the extraordinary paſſion and intereſt I ſhew'd at the knowledg of her misfortunes, which did endear me the more unto her: But ſeing me in that condition they would have conveigh'd me to bed, till I at laſt perfectly recovering my ſelf diverted their intentions, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51633:79"/> aſham'd at the trouble I had put them to, I excuſ'd it as well as I could. Dear <hi>Sabane</hi> (ſaid <hi>Atalanta</hi>) you are too much mov'd at the misfortunes of another, I cannot but wonder that your magnanimous ſoul bearing your own ſo well ſhould be ſo much troubled at the audition of mine. The moſt ſaxean hearts madam (replyed I) cannot but commiſerate your condition, nor none that ſhall hear your misfortunes but will curſe that perfidious <hi>Marcipſius.</hi> But that which ſo much amazed me was, that that wicked vitiator ſhould be ſo blinded as not to ſee his own happyneſſe, but ſhould forſake a beauty to which the Gods themſelves might have lay'd a clame; as being too good for the beſt of men.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words imbued the native virmilion of her cheeks with a deeper crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in graine: See ſee continued <hi>I</hi> poynting to the wall which at that time (by reaſon of a damp) ſtood full of moyſt drops on his hard ſide the very ſtones ſend forth their ſudor, and ſeem to generate teares out of their rocky ſubſtance, that they might make you ſee by their weeping they have ſome kinde of feeling of your misfortunes, can you then wonder how I ſhould be ſo much mov'd, when inanimates elſe would convince me of obdurateneſſe. I ſee (replyed ſhe a little ſmiling) that there is no contending with one that out of all objects will raiſe ſome evincing argument. I that before was a comforter, lack'd now to be comforted, I that allwayes coveted the company of <hi>Atalanta,</hi> now oftentimes ſhun'd it that I might ſecreetly vent my complaints, and feed my ſadneſſe with ſolitary ſoliloquies, all things were quite altered, and <hi>I</hi> could not but be amaz'd as griev'd at the verſutous power of that mutable Goddeſs. They all ſaw my change but they could not well divine what might be the reaſon of't, I was now wholly eaten up with ſadneſſe, and conſum'd my time in trouble, in teares, and complaints, againſt heaven, earth, <hi>Marcipſius,</hi> and my ſelf. In the very extreemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my trouble <hi>I</hi> ſhould oft cry out ah! I am conſtrain'd I am conſtrained to leave thee! <hi>Atalanta</hi> began to repay thoſe comfortable ſpeeches I was uſ'd to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace her with, and to become my phyſitian as I had been hers, which indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of comforting me encreaſt my dolor, when <hi>I</hi> thought on my loſs, for by how much the more ſhe was good to me, and by how much the more the goodneſſe of her nature was exhibited, by ſo much the more I bewail'd my loſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the greatneſſe of my misfortune. This grief and trouble continuing, it at laſt induc'd me to a ſickneſſe, which perplexed every one of that ſmall fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by reaſon of the Love they bore me, but <hi>Atalanta</hi> principally ſeem'd to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her own trouble to engage her ſelf into mine, and ſought the acquireing of my health almoſt with the loſſe of her own. In this ſickneſſe I found ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of my grief, and by degrees began to overcome it, and to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with my fortune. Not that I loſt any part or jot of the love I bore <hi>Atalanta</hi> but framing my ſelfe, ſeeing I could no longer love her as a miſtres, to love her as a ſiſter, and to keep my love entire without deſire of any other poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion then I enjoyed. To comfort and pleaſe my ſelf with this kind of <hi>Platonick</hi> love: to love only for virtues ſake, to have a paſſion with out car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal defires I ſought many arguments to maintaine it to my ſelf, that it was the beſt love, and ſeem'd moſt Caeleſtiall. I would thus ſometimes ſay to my ſelf.</p>

No doubt but <hi>Marcipſius</hi> lov'd her before he enjoy'd, but in enjoying her his love was quench'd. Seeing therefore after ſome ſmall pleaſure the flames
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51633:79"/> of Love are often extinguiſhed, or abated, is it not better to love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ends or any other deſire of enjoyment than that which is between a brother and ſiſter; which is pure and caeleſtiall and not ſubject to decay? Let it be ſo and then there will be no obſtacle for this love; no doubt but her amity if ſhe knows me, will grant this in conſideration of my love and honeſty. I may enjoy all the pleaſures that may be, except that which ſerves but to put out the fire of glowing love. Hath not my pleaſure been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, in this ſmall time that I have been here? and have I not thought that poſſeſſion could give me no greater pleaſure? This ſame I may ſtill enjoy, which is purer than ordinary love, uncontaminate, full of chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, free from vitious thoughts and deſires, and kindled not by <hi>Cupid</hi> but by <hi>Jove,</hi> being a ſparke or ſcintilla of the ſame fire, where with he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames our ſoules with love to himſelfe, and which we exhibit in loveing virtue, which is his gift: this love will not faile, this is paſt the power of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to croſſe, with many ſuch diſcourſes as theſe I ſought prettily to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile my ſelf, and at laſt I reſolved ro love her as my ſiſter, ſince I could not enjoy her as my miſtris.</p>
                  <p>In this reſolution I perſiſted, and beguiling my grief, recovered my health: I began (and verily at laſt effected it) to baniſh not the love, but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate deſire <hi>I</hi> had to <hi>Atalanta.</hi> I did not preſent her to my imagination (as I uſ'd to do) in my armes, or in thoſe cloſe unſeen embraces of lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; yet did I not baniſh her thence but look't upon her as part of my ſoule and for whoſe content the ſacrifizeing of my life was but a trifle, and (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was my imagination or no I will not determine) I thought I felt ſtronger flames and ſtronger love than ever, it ſeemed to be a far different fire, more pure, more celeſtial, ſeemed to afford more content and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure than the other.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt I thus pleaſ'd my ſelf in this new kind of love and every day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the utmoſt of my wiſhes, time who had ſeem'd to me to borrow pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous ſailes for his greater ſpeed, brought forth that moneth wherein <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talanta</hi> expected her lying down. The time was very near that ſhe had ſo long expected, and now a new grief poſſeſt me, in that I muſt be forc'd to leave her, and new fear poſſeſſed me in that I muſt be forc'd to make my ſelf known to her. I ſtill boar her a paſſionate love and dreaded her anger as much as <hi>Jove's</hi> thunder. But there was a neceſſity of it, Modeſty would not permit me to ſtay any longer to be preſent at an action which required only the preſence of the bearing ſex. I could not tell how to depart, nor to be abſent at the time of her delivery without her knowing what <hi>I</hi> was, ſeeing this neceſſity <hi>I</hi> reſolved at length to make my ſelf known to her, but fear and trouble ſo long detered it, that <hi>Atalanta</hi> fell ſick and kept her bed and looked every hower for her paritude, when I ſaw there was no time for any cunctation I embraced the firſt opportunity which was the next day after ſhe had taken her bed, and being alone with her I ſat down by her upon the bed ſide, but ſo full of feare and trembling that <hi>I</hi> was not able to unglew my lips, and my face ſo pale that it exhibited I was going about an action on which depended the quiet of all my remaining dayes. <hi>I</hi> know not any thing like to the trouble <hi>I</hi> was in at that time knowing my ſelfe guilty of deludeing that innocent. I ſat a while with a wondrous emotion within me at laſt diſturbing her repoſe with my ingeminated ſighs, I could not refraine from ſhedding ſome love drops. <hi>Atalanta</hi> fixing her eyes upon mine, and reading the trouble in my face, what (ſaid ſhe) are theſe tears to ſupply the place of mine? indeed <hi>I</hi> have through exceſſe drawn my ſprings dry, but it is unequall that you ſhould ſo much ſorrow for my crime. No Maddam (ſaid <hi>I</hi> tremblingly) it is for my own crimes that I weep, and for the trouble <hi>I</hi> have that I muſt leave you. I emitted theſe words with ſo languiſhing an air, that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51633:80"/> they peirc't her gentle ſoul: leave me? (replyed ſhe) <hi>I</hi> hope you will not leave me in this diſtreſſe: By your comforts I have been preſerv'd and now <hi>I</hi> have moſt need of them do you ſpeak of leaving me; what is the reaſon <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane?</hi> alas! I am too unworthy for thy company, I am too contaminate for thy purity. At thoſe words reaching out her hand which might have been compared with the mountaine ſnow ſhe lockt it within mine, and with an action full of love, preſſed it between hers, her eyes then ſhew'd that her ſprings were not utterly dry, or elſe that love had cauſed new ones. This action piercing my heart <hi>I</hi> was not able to do any thing but ſuſpire, but at laſt bringing forth words and ſighs together. Ah! maddam (ſaid I) the time is come that I muſt be forc't to leave you; the Gods for theſe few months have made me happy by your ſight and now they will make me more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by forceing me to leave you. There is but one thing that I can hope for, and that's your pardon without which my death is inevitable, but my crime is ſo great that I can expect no mercy from you, did <hi>I</hi> not know that your goodneſſe far excells all others that live.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw by her amazedneſſe that ſhe knew not the meaning of theſe <hi>aenigma's,</hi> But (proceeded I) the time is now come, according to the appointment of the Gods that my deceit muſt be manifeſted, that I muſt implore your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for my life, and pardon for my crime, or dye for the expiation of my fault: behold an impoſtor, (flinging my ſelfe upon my knees as I ſpake) that hath wronged you, that hath deluded you, ſay, can you find in your heart to forgive one who hath abuſed your goodneſſe by an impoſture? <hi>Sabane</hi> (ſaid <hi>Atalanta</hi> much amazed) what meane you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can you have committed any thing againſt me that ſhould deſerve this? Let it be what it will I pardon it, if it be any thing that you think you have committed againſt me, my ſoul is not dearer to me than thou art, draw me out of this trouble which thou haſt cauſed quickly, dear <hi>Sabane! I</hi> muſt not ſuffer you any longer in this error (returned I) you have been abuſed long enough, <hi>I</hi> am no longer <hi>Sabane</hi> but (as you may well know my deceit) I am <hi>Lonoxia</hi> brother to the wicked <hi>Marcipſius,</hi> he it is that was baniſht his fathers pallace, that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally was tranſported to <hi>Oliſſipo,</hi> that eſpied your charmes at a diſtance walking on the river <hi>Tagus,</hi> that then oſt his heart and vowd it to you as his peculiar Goddeſſe, and laſtly inveſting himſelf with this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, to enjoy that happineſſe without which he was no longer able to live, he invented a figment to deceive you, and all this time hath been an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, and now knowing through a ſtrange providence how nearly you have been engaged to his brother, he quits all pretenſions of being your ſervant any further than the laws of civillity and duty bind. <hi>Atalanta</hi> at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant let goe my hand, and looking upon me with an eye, in which <hi>I</hi> ſaw at once both pity and anger, killed and revived my ſoul at the ſame time. Bluſhes and paleneſſe took their turnes in her cheecks, and amazed ſhe ſtay'd in a ſuſpence, not knowing how to anſwer, which cauſed me to ſpeak thus. Maddam behold a criminall that implores your goodneſſe, though <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſſe my crimes of ſo high a nature that they are almoſt impardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the moſt mercifull. <hi>I</hi> deſerve to be hated if <hi>I</hi> had been innocent, in that <hi>I</hi> am allied ſo nearly to hatefull <hi>Marcipſius.</hi> But ah <hi>Atalanta!</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get theſe reſentments, and let pity exuſcitate your pardon, remember that you have promiſed of what nature ſoever my crimes were to grant it! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the love you have borne <hi>Sabane,</hi> let it not be converted to hatred to <hi>Lonoxia!</hi> That is it <hi>I</hi> beg may be continued, that your opinion of my goodneſſe may not be diminiſhed by this knowledge. Alas to forgive my crimes and to hate me is but to kill me through grief, <hi>I</hi> will freely offer my life as an expiament for my impoſture, ſo that after my death, you will but retain me whole in your memory without remembring my crimes. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51633:80"/> that <hi>Sabane,</hi> though an impoſtor never did any thing that may make your virtue bluſh to remember it. It was love made me excurre into this crime, on that I lay all the fault, that you may be the better induced to forgive me, ſince your ſelfe have been deceived by him. Love <hi>I</hi> ſay Love hath been of ſuch force as to make me thus diſguiſe my ſelf, happy diſguiſe, under which <hi>I</hi> have received ſo many favours of divine <hi>Atalanta,</hi> under which I have received that content which might have been envied by the Gods, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which <hi>I</hi> have enjoyed the ſight of my titular angell. But curſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe! under which I have prov'd an Impoſtor to innocent <hi>Atalanta.</hi> I have loved you hoping rhat time might have made me worthy through my long ſervices, to have attained to that which now is not lawfull to thinke on: But by a peculiar providence of the Gods finding that my brother hath made you his, though (accurſed!) he hath forſaken you, my deſignes which were honeſt, are diverted, and <hi>I</hi> forced at length after my ſorrow and ſickneſſe to confeſſe it; nevertheleſſe, though I deſire nothing at your hands, my Love is inconvertible, but it beares the ſame ſtamp that a brothers hath to a ſiſter, or is the ſame that your ſelf (divin <hi>Atalanta!</hi>) bore to the faign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sabane,</hi> after this free agnition let the remembrance of <hi>Sabane</hi> ſtir up your pity, your pity your pardon, and your pardon give life to <hi>Lonoxia,</hi> who elſe dies to ſatisfie you for his impoſture. <hi>I</hi> ended with theſe words, and my eyes being full of tears <hi>I</hi> awaited her ſentence. Remaining thus for ſomtime <hi>I</hi> ſaw that this ſudden and unexpected accident had made her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable. What maddam (ſaid I) cannot you yet determine what ſentence to paſſe on this wretch, whether life or death? Alas! though you'r lought to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo ſevere a ſentance from ſo meak a ſoul, I perceive you'd have the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor dye, but you'r lought to paſſe the ſentance from your mouth: you are not in a ſuſpence whether he ought to live or no, but whether you ought to command it.

At that inſtant trembling and caſting my eyes about I eſpied a knife at the beds feet which I ſuddenly ſnatched, and plucking open my boſome. I will, I will Madam (cryed I) give you ſatisfaction, this ſhall execute your will. As I lifted up my hand to have let her ſeen that I regarded my life leſſe than her love, and fear'd the looſing of it leſſe than the acquiring her anger, ſhe caught hold on my arme; <hi>Sabane</hi> (ſaid ſhe) ſo I muſt yet call you, <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſent to this rigorous chaſtizement.

Raviſh'd at theſe words I caſt my ſelf at her feet. Ah <hi>Madam</hi> (cry'd I) now I can dye content! this is more than <hi>I</hi> have merited, but it pleaſes the goodneſſe of <hi>Atalanta</hi> to be equally mercifull with the Gods. The ancient Lady raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me from that humble poſture led me to <hi>Atalanta</hi>'s bed ſide, who bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gave me her hand in ſign of confirmation of what her Governeſſe had ſaid. Ah (ſaid ſhe ſighing) have I made known my weakneſſe to a man! ſtrange providence! the brother of the cauſer of my woes. The fidelity and Loyalty of the one (ſaid her Governeſſe) ſhall repay the perfideouſneſſe and diſloyalty of the other. Who'd thinke nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could produce two ſuch contraries out of one <hi>Venter,</hi> the one is not ſo wicked, but the other is as good, the one is the abſtract of Iniquity, the other of Goodneſſe and conſtancy. Many ſuch prayſes that lady out of the depth of her Goodneſſe was pleaſ'd to give me. At their requeſt <hi>I</hi> gave them the relation of my life, and how providentially I was brought to <hi>Oliſsippo,</hi> with the beginning of my Love. Me thought (ſaid <hi>Atalanta) I</hi> ſaw the lineaments of <hi>Marcipſius</hi> face in yours, when <hi>I</hi> firſt ſaw you, but <hi>I</hi> attributed it to the effect of a vain imaginatioin: That treacherous one hath not alone prov'd perfidious to me, but a foe and traitour to you. They were pleaſ'd to Commiſerate my condition, although their own were enough to imploy all their thoughts. The deception of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipſius</hi> held us in diſcourſe the reſt of the day, at laſt they concluded, ſince the providence of the Gods was ſo manifeſtly ſeen in bringing me to that place, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould take care of the Infant that ſhould be produc'd into the world, and to bear it thence, leaſt the Crime of <hi>Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanta</hi> ſhould be made conſpicuous to the world.

Preſently the furious winds muſtering their forces on the plaines of the ocean, began to aſtuate the face of the waters, into living mountaines, which moveing with a horrible ſight, threatned us with a tumulation under their liquid ruins, but our barque forceing its way to the top of thoſe watry rocks, with the like impetuoſity deſcended down their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Our ſhip ſlead for many leagues before the fury of the winds, on thoſe roughned plaines, the ſtrength of the mariners proving too weak to ſtrive with the violence of that impetuous ſtorm, they committed it to the mercy of the winds and water, and prepared themſelves to receive an inevitable death. Morning appearing, but the ſtorme not ceaſing, we ſtill rode upon the dangerous waves, till at laſt our barque ſhattered with the continuall batteries both of <hi>Boreas</hi> and <hi>Neptune,</hi> gave entrance to that aquatick enemy into its very bowells, and running a leak preſantly was fill'd with water. Every one ſought to ſave himſelf, but there was no meanes to eſcape periſhing, ſome cut the tackle, others the maſts, others caſt themſelves before hand into the ſea, at laſt the ſhip ſanke, at which ſo horrible and lamentable a cry, proceeded from thoſe deplorable wretches that I thought it would have relented the Gods of their Cruelty to have ſav'd them miraculouſly. The child being laid in the cheſt which admitted no water, was toſſed upon the waves, and caried out of my ſight in a moment: The deſire I had to ſee <hi>Atalanta</hi> made me endeavour, to ſave my life, which <hi>I</hi> cid by gaining the maſt of the Ship, on which I ſat and beheld the reſt periſh in the ſea, without being able to afford them help.</p>
                  <p>I was driven for Some howers by the waves, which many times had allmoſt made me forgo my hold, with their violences, and playing with my looſer garment had put me to much trouble to keep ſteady on that dancing pole, when at laſt by the favour of the Gods I was eſpied by a veſſel which yet tryumph'd o're the ſtorme, which at that time ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning its violence gave them the liberty of ſaving me. The veſſell was bound for <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo that they were eaſily induc'd to land me at <hi>Oliſippo</hi> for the rewards <hi>I</hi> profer'd them, all the jewells and things of worth that were about me <hi>I</hi> beſtow'd on them. The pilot being very skillfull in his art ſet me aſhore in the Haven of <hi>Oliſſippo</hi> in ſpite of the raging waters. <hi>I</hi> preſently repaired to <hi>Atalanta's</hi> Ile, and being admitted, <hi>I</hi> was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted that ſhe had not many minutes to live. The greif that then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me its impoſſible to relate, <hi>I</hi> ran to her bed ſide and like one diſtacted ask'd her many fooliſh and impertinent queſtions, as why ſhe for ſake us? and why ſhe ſhould not endure any companies in this world? and why ſhe would not overcome her grief and ſorrow? The old lady with her chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt maids weeping by her made a very ſad and dolefull ſpectacle, but ſhe glad that ſhe was departing from this world, wherein ſhe had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much ſorrow and greif, lay ſmiling at the frowns of death, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd him with a chearfull countenance.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as ſhe ſaw me ſhe invited me with her dying eyes to draw near; in the mean time thoſe that ſtood by her bed ſide ſeeing ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired privacy withdrew a little. She firſt ask'd me concerning the child whoſe misfortunes I hid from her, leſt the knowledg of that might have ſhortned thoſe few moments ſhe had to live. I told her that it was ſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for, and that ſhe ſhould not fear but that I would imploy the remainder of my dayes in fullfilling her deſire. This is all then ſaid ſhe, beſides what allready I have told you, that you let <hi>Marcipſius</hi> know he was the cauſe of my death, and if he publiſheth my diſhonour <hi>I</hi> hope though he be your brother that you will deſend me. One thing yet grievs me and that is that I muſt part with <hi>Sabane;</hi> her teares and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſtopp'd her here; and I with the exceſſe of paſſion could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer her one word, but kneeling down <hi>I</hi> gave her an aſſurance by my eyes that I would effect what ever ſhe commanded, my teares ſhew'd
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51633:82"/> her with what reſentment <hi>I</hi> beheld her dyeing, and the greatneſſe of my grief clearly deprived me of my ſenſes. At that time arrived <hi>Atalanta's</hi> father whom they had ſent for, and coming where his daughter lay, he ſhewed his love was exceſſive, for, beholding her ready to expire, he fell by her ſide, and had almoſt deceived all their hopes of ever fetching him again, but at laſt coming to himſelf he embraced the dying <hi>Atalanta,</hi> who had the content to expire in his armes. When they ſaw ſhe was dead, then began a heavy ejulation, all ſeeking to expreſs their paſſion by their ſeveral geſtures and actions. The old man to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>caſſe, I fell on her pillow with the extremity of my paſſion, and there lay ſo ſenſleſſe that it was hard to judge who was deadeſt. But after a long time my ſenſes returning to exerciſe their functions, I caſt my eyes obſcured with teares on that face which triumphing over death carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yet weapons enough to have captivated the ſtouteſt hearts. The conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lillies began now to overcome the roſes in her cheeks, and they as it were yeilding to the hand of fate ſunke their bluſhing heads under the ſnow of her cheeks, which gave a kind of a dying tincture to the white. There was nothing to be ſeen of death but want of heat and motion, and had you but ſeen her you would have ſaid that it was the faireſt of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that in the kingdome of <hi>Morpheus</hi> was taking her ſweeter repoſe. My griefe permitted me not to read to my ſelf lectures of mortality, but by ſtimulating conſiderations put me into motions of ſury, Oh! how often I ſecretly curſt that cruell brother, how often <hi>I</hi> vowed her revenge, and how often reſolved I to ſarcrifice the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Marcipſius,</hi> on the altar of vengance, 'twas theſe reſolutions that kept me from following that faire one to the <hi>Eliſian</hi> ſhades, and ty'd me to endure thoſe ſorrows by living, which I was neceſſitated to undergo ſince ſhe was dead.</p>
                  <p>But the old Lady having f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>When that they had tyred, but not ſatisfied themſelves with weeping, they were ſain to reſolve for the interment of that lovely carcaſe which was yet vain without its more heavenly part the ſoul. I will not ſtand to diſcribe that funerall pomp though the ſtatelineſſe and richneſſe of it gave admiration and matter of diſcourſe for all <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ine.</hi> For the old prince having loſt that rare and ineſtimable jewell his daughter for whom he preſerv'd his other riches, ſo little regarded them, that he beſtowed his whole treaſure in her interment, and buried with her, a maſſe of Gold and pretious ſtones. <hi>I</hi> was an aſſiſtant in theſe ſad ceremonies, but my griefe took from me all obſervance. The father of <hi>Atalanta</hi> beeing converſant with the <hi>Romans</hi> obſerv'd many of their ceremonies in the interment, and many things he
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51633:83"/> had which was new and of his own inſtitution. That lovely corpes haveing laine extinct ſeven dayes in which were emitted a thouſand <hi>Conclamations</hi> if that could have recalled her from her eternall ſleep, it was eviſcerated and condited by ſome <hi>Roman pollinctors:</hi> And on the <hi>Acerra</hi> was offerred a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall and daily incenſe till the day of her exequial ſhew. The prince ſparing for no coſt imployed ſo many workmen that he had prepared all things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the time of buriall to his minde, and ſhew'd the little value he ſet upon riches ſince his daughter was dead. <hi>I</hi> ſhould darken the ſplendor of that pomp ſhould I goe about to tell it you, for it far ſurpaſſ'd both for riches and funerary heavineſſe, all that ever the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhewed in their exequies. Above a thouſand ſmall veſſels whoſe ſides were of black ebon oar's, of the ſame, and ſailes and tackle of obnigerous ſilke with many precious ſtones faſtned to them, which glittring ſeem'd like ſo many ſtarrs in a black firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The night being witneſſe of theſe ſad ceremonies they ſupplyed the want of <hi>Sol</hi> with I know not how many thouſand tapers which ſo enbright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the place that the veſſells with eaſe ſaw how to place themſelves in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the <hi>Tagus</hi> groan'd under the weight of ſo great a multitude, and hid his head for feare of ſo many fires; leaſt they had been come to have burnt up all his waters. In the fore part of theſe funerall ſhips were plac'd certaine men with trumpets and other inſtruments who ſounded them with triſtfull notes according to the heavy plangor and ejulation of the <hi>praeficae</hi> and <hi>funcrae</hi> that followed. ſix veſſels richer than the former followed, three of which were fill'd with little youths dreſſed up like little <hi>Cupids</hi> all in mourning attire, who with a <hi>Lydian</hi> ſtrain ſung the <hi>Thornodia</hi> with heavenly voyces, which would have drawn teares from ſlinty hearts, had not the ſadneſſe of the occaſion been a greater motive to a totall diſſolution into tears. The three other veſſels was fill'd with the fait'ſt <hi>puella's</hi> that part of <hi>Spaine</hi> could afford, who in their black attires dreſt like <hi>Nymphs</hi> (which ſeem'd to vail their bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) accorded with ſweet harmony their voyces (which ſurpaſt the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of the ſpheres) to the ſad notes of divers harpes, Lutes, Lyres, Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, and other muſick on which they play'd. In the mid'ſt of them one taller than the reſt repreſenting <hi>Melpomene</hi> ſweetly and ſadly <hi>Cithari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeing</hi> to her voyce, ſung the <hi>Epicedium</hi> with accents raviſhingly ſweet.</p>
                  <p>After theſe in order followed the other veſſels fill'd with thoſe that came to accompany <hi>Atalanta</hi> to her interment. At the end of which traine a greater veſſell than the reſt ſhining on all parts with the ſplendor of rich ſtones encompaſted about with divers veſſels full of lights ſadly followed the reſt, in which was <hi>Atalanta</hi>'s corps, plac'd in a bed in faſhion of a throne ineſtimable for the richneſſe that adorn'd it. About which ſat the <hi>Prince,</hi> my ſelf, and her ſervants, making a concention with ſighs and groans. Behind that bed in another lay the Lady, with other ſervants paying their laſt duty in tears and fighs about her. In this manner we went to <hi>Oliſſippo,</hi> and landing went to a temple conſecrated to the <hi>Superbious Juno</hi> where in a vault arch'd over with marble and emboſ'd, with precious ſtones ſhe was lai'd with the ancient Lady, and all the riches that addorn'd her. After the <hi>Vale</hi> pronounced by the <hi>praefica's</hi> every one returned almoſt dead with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and griefe, for never was there ſeen ſuch a generall lamentation and conſent in mourning before. Whilſt they were returning the <hi>Cupids</hi> and <hi>Nymphs</hi> ſinging <hi>Elegiaic</hi> verſes before them, my ſorrow burſting out a freſh in thinking to have <hi>Atalanta,</hi> I got away unſeen and remained behinde: And getting into the vailt, I lay bewailing my deſtiny over <hi>Atalanta,</hi> till thoſe that were ſet to cloſe up the vault pluckt me thence by violence, for my deſire was to be cloſ'd up with her. But when they had cloſ'd up that ſepulchre and raiz'd a little <hi>Pyramis</hi> over it of Jaſper, I cauſ'd to be engraven on the ſide of it theſe words in the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue, and burniſht with Gold.</p>

                  <p>AFter I had given thouſands of kiſſes upon the cold <hi>Jaſper,</hi> and with my teares renewed the fading cypreſſe branches which adorned her tombe I departed into the City, and chainging that long-kept habit, I indued thoſe garments proper to my ſex, and in a moſt ſad and deplorable condition I ombarqu'd my ſelfe for <hi>Lixus.</hi> Aſſoon as I arrived there I met with a new and exceſſive accretion of ſorrow. I found my father dead, not without ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of poyſon, and my mother too weake to overcome her ſad reſentments of my brothers wickedneſſe, my other brothers death, my baniſhment, and laſtly my fathers murther, ſhe gave up the ghoſt that day I arrived at <hi>Lixus</hi> ſome few dayes after my father. This joyned to the remembrance of <hi>Atalanta</hi> had ſurely overcome me, but that I was obliged to performe the injunction of <hi>Atalanta,</hi> and to revenge the death of my father by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the blood of my brother, that wicked paricide, for without doubt he had compaſſed his death by poyſon. Fearing his malice and wickedneſſe <hi>I</hi> kept my ſelfe unknown, and diſguiſed ſaw their bodies ſepulized, which was performed with great ceremony and funerary pomp by that hypocrite <hi>Marcipſius.</hi> The ſight of that Traitor ſo irritated me that I was about to have ſacrificed him on the tomb of my father, and to have immolated his blood to the Ghoſt of <hi>Atalanta,</hi> at the interment, but not deſiring to make my ſelfe known before all thoſe mourners with ſome other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, deterred me from putting ſo bloody a cataſtrophe to the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. The next day I prepared my ſelfe to encounter him, and was reſolv'd no longer to deferre his puniſhment: But I underſtood he had anticipated my deſign by departing from thence towards <hi>Tingis,</hi> where he was in Love with his Couſin the princeſſe of <hi>Bogudianae,</hi> and daughter of King <hi>Bogudus</hi> by whom he hoped to attaine the crown of <hi>Tingitania. I</hi> thought his love extreamly great, or his ſorrow very ſmall that de departed ſo ſuddenly after the interment however I reſolved to follow him and perpetrate my deſign
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51633:84"/> though in the armes of his beloved. With this reſolution without diſcovering my ſelfe I left <hi>Lixus</hi> and at laſt arrived at <hi>Tingis.</hi> Some few dayes <hi>I</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waited an opportunity to meet with him, which at laſt was given me as happily as I could wiſh; for walking in a little grove hard by the pallace, it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt evening, I ſaw him come forth of a back dore of the pallace garden only with one ſquire. He deſcended into the grove and muſing with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe gave me liberty to come very near him before he eſpied me. when I was come up to him, my reſentments ſtimulating me to a revenge, Traitor (ſaid <hi>I</hi> laying my hand upon my ſword) at this very inſtant thou muſt give ſatisfaction with thy blood and life for two murthers commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thee, that of thy father and that of thy wife. <hi>Marcipſius</hi> was ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at this ſudden encounter, ſteping back and being nothing daunted drew his ſword. I am lougth (reply'd he) to take away your life for your teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but you ought before you encounter any with your tongue, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them well with your eyes, and not let your raſhneſſe induce you into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that would, with one leſſe mercifull than my ſelf, before this time have coſt you your life. No, Monſter (reply'd I) am not deceiv'd, 'tis you that are deceived in thinking ſo, I ſee you know me not, but know I know you to be the moſt perfidious and patricidicall <hi>Marcipſius,</hi> to be the raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and vitiator of divine <hi>Atalanta,</hi> who ſuffered the ſtroke of death in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world the infant form'd of thy moſt luſtfull ſeed: it is to her Ghoſt that the expiation of thy life in the firſt place muſt give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the next place to thy empoyſoned father who through thy ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefication (ſcelerous wretch!) hath ended his dayes: and this muſt be by the hand of <hi>Lonoxia</hi> who hath liv'd hitherto but to give ſatisfaction to their <hi>Umbrae</hi> by immolation of thy life. He was much amazed in ſeeing me, and ſeeing me ready to ſacrifice his life with the ſword of vengance, he ſaw there was no time to delay defending himſelf, for I aſſaulted him with a free violence. His fury and deſpair aſſembled in him an unwonted force, and had I not with the like agility evaded his firſt thruſt he had ſtocadoed me, and given a period to my Life and fury, our duel laſted ſome time, till at length he fell, having a thruſt through his right arme, and another through his body, ſo that <hi>I</hi> thought him dead, and leaving him I departed that night in a veſſel for <hi>Spain.</hi> As we were paſſing the narrow frete that divides <hi>Spain</hi> from <hi>Affrica,</hi> we were ſet upon by a veſſell of reſolute pyrates, we were but few in number to them, and they thought it a folly to gain death by a reſiſtance, but <hi>I</hi> that ſought ardently for that megre champion, ſince I had obey'd the commands of <hi>Atalanta,</hi> reſolved to looſe it deſperately amongſt them, and at the laſt extinguiſhing of my taper, to give the greateſt blaſe of my valour. Aſſoon as they had boarded us, I alone reſiſted them, and leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt them, irritated them by the blowes I gave them, at firſt think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me mad with folly or raſhneſſe, they did not much regard me, but when that they ſaw how faſt I fell'd them, they all began to diſpute it with me with their ſwords, and to deprive me of the life <hi>I</hi> was reſolved to looſe, but with their deaths. In this encounter fell their captain with nine more that expired through their blood and wounds, at laſt everpowred <hi>I</hi> was born down, and expecting death, fortune, to ſpight me gave me, life. I looked for no generoſity amongſt thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> nor no pity from ſuch irritated ſoules. But they made it appear that valour had ſome eſtimation amongſt them, and that they were not altogether ſo Brutuall as I thought them. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the ſmall puiſſance that I had ſhewed amongſt them they preſerved my life, and proffer'd me my liberty, notwithſtanding the ſlaughter, I had made. And ſeeing their captain dead they all joyntly prayed me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of their vaſſallage, and his place, and power. I many times deny'd them, and proffer'd to be their companion, but they told me that my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51633:84"/> which they ſo much reſpected deſerved the preeminency and that they ſhould account themſelves happy under my protection, and that they would fear nothing under my conduct, but if I would accept of their proffers that they would ſwear a blind obedience to my commands, and would follow me to death it ſelfe. I pondered for ſome time on their words, and believing that to be the readieſt way to find the death <hi>I</hi> ſought, I yielded to them, and accepted of their offer. For my ſake they ſpared the veſſel they had aſſaulted, and carrying me to a ſtrong fort on the ſide of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firica</hi> placed between two rocks ſufficient to fruſtrate the efforts of a ſtrong army, where when all their <hi>pyratick</hi> veſſels were come in they proclamed me with a generall conſent to be their captain; and with ceremonies peculiar amongſt themſelves crowned me with a Diadem made of cable ropes untwin'd in which was placed many precious ſtones, and ſwore their obedience to me, never to forſake me though in the greateſt peril, never to diſobey my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or thwart my deſignes, or to ranſaek the prey but to ſtand to my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of it amongſt them. By this means they ever were in obedience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, and in their common ſtorehouſe had treaſure enough to defray the charges of an army of an hundred thouſand men.</p>
                  <p>I led this pyratick life about two years in which time I receiv'd a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand proofs of the <hi>Pirats</hi> valour and obedience, which was as perfect as the greateſt monark could receive from his meaneſt ſubjects. In it <hi>I</hi> found a life (if I may ſay ſo for the conſideration of the unlawfullneſſe of it) that was pleaſant and free from the verſatilouſneſſe of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and I ſeemed now as if I tryumph'd over the power of that deity. There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the world could afford or the induſtry and power of men could gaine, ſo abſolute a regency had I acquir'd over the hearts of thoſe that ſerv'd me, that if I deſired it they would ſacrifice all their lives but they'd content me. All outward bliſſe attended me, and I wanted nothing of the pleaſures and deliciouſneſſe of the greateſt princes. But yet <hi>Atalanta</hi> was a ſpectre that alwayes appear'd before my eyes, and ſeem'd to deſire my company in the <hi>Eliſium.</hi> Indeed <hi>I</hi> ſought death every where, where I hop'd I might finde it, I led them to moſt apparent dangers, which yet their valour ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and in the greateſt atchivements came off victorious, and without murmuring at my actions, and with a deſperatneſſe of a man reſolv'd for death I fought againſt all oppoſers, and incurr'd all dangers, which raſhneſs they accounted the effects of an extream valour, and their love made them as reſolute as my ſelfe: by which means, as fortune had rob'd me of my content and diſpoſſeſſed me of my greateſt riches, ſo now becoming her exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner I made others miſerable by their loſſes who ſeemed to be her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourities, and enriched the coffers of my <hi>praedonians</hi> with inaeſtimable treaſure taken on the Seas. It was now that fortune gave me a very happy encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and made me ſome amends for her former injuries, I was gliding over the <hi>Tuſcane</hi> ſea when I perceiv'd one of my veſſels in fight with another, I bore up to her to afford her my helpe and to make ſure of the prey but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I</hi> came, <hi>I</hi> perceived that ſhe was taken, and my men ſlain and priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, a thing not uſual it was, to ſee them overcome, which made me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhould find ſo ſtout a reſiſtance that I ſhould not ſeek any further for the death I wiſh'd for, I came up encouraging my men to revenge the death of their fellows, and falling abord on them <hi>I</hi> expected a ſufficient number of them to reſiſt me, but I wondered to ſee ſo many ſlain and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners by the prodigious valour of one man. A ſhamed to aſſault him with ſo many, <hi>I</hi> commanded them to keep their ſhip, and to leave me the glory of that combate. They obeying me <hi>I</hi> entred the ſhip wherein <hi>Euripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> had done ſuch wonders (for it was he) and encountering him <hi>I</hi> found that I had need of the aſſiſtance of all my men to overcome him. I ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51633:85"/> the ſury of his arm at leaſt an hower, but not without wounds, and undoubtedly I had fell under his ſtrenuous arme, had not my men at that time breaking their wonted obedience through the great fear they had of my life ruſhed all into the ſhip to aſſaile him. I was extraordinarily moved at their baſeneſſe and fearing their temerity I turned about and defended my enemy. What (ſaid <hi>I</hi> oppoſing them with my ſword) after all your loyalty will you now give me proofs of your diſobedience, I had thought you had not been capable of ſuch baſeneſſe. <hi>I</hi> have hitherto oppoſed my ſelf againſt a valour that is invincible, but now i'le defend my enemy rather then ſuffer this ignobility. Theſe words ſtoped their motion and made them retire: turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to <hi>Euripdes,</hi> Sir (ſaid I) you ſhall have no odds, lets finiſh what you have ſo bravely begun. <hi>Euripeles</hi> being truly generous, replyed, It is a folly to opoſe you, ſince you have two weapons which make you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, valour and generoſity, it is enough that you have overcome me with the firſt, let me not be altogether conquered in the laſt. I proffer you my ſword and ſervice, and give you all the ſignals of victory. Alas! (ſaid I) how unjuſtly you attribute this to me, which I ought to have given you: But we muſt finiſh our combate, 'tis not out of hopes that I ſhall prove the victor, 'tis a thing I deſire not, but out of a deſire <hi>I</hi> have to receive the death I have ſo long ſought by the hand of one ſo valorous. You ſhall never find it under mine (reply'd the generous <hi>Euripedes</hi>) I will not commit ſo heynous a crime as to offend my defender, but if you'l ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me with your friendſhip, <hi>I</hi> ſhall prize it above the victory; if not, yet give me leave to render you proofes of my ſervitude. With that he offered me the pummel of his ſword: <hi>I</hi> was vext at his refuſal to fight, and ſtepping back <hi>I</hi> bid him ſtand upon his guard, and thinking to irritate him with my blows, I renew'd the fight; he indeed defended himſelf, but would not ſtrike to hurt me. What (ſaid I very angry) you eſteem me not worthy enough to exerciſe your valour upon: with this giving him a force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able blow, his guard being low, I cut his hand wriſt, and as fortune would, a braſlet which ſurrounded it. This put a period to my anger, for I no ſooner ſaw it, but I knew it by a remarkable ſtone in the midſt of it, to be the ſame that I had put about the neck of <hi>Atalanta</hi>'s child. <hi>I</hi> took it up, and with an action that teſtified my amazedneſs <hi>I</hi> beheld it, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring my ſelf that it was the ſame, I was not ſlack to know of him how he had acquired it. He very courteouſly ſatisfying my demand, I muſt live now (cryed I out) ſince duty binds me to perform what I owe to <hi>Atalanta.</hi> O gods! what ought I to expect from that infant, ſince ye have preſerv'd it ſo miraculouſly: I preſently crav'd pardon for my inſolencies, and it was as ſoon granted by generous <hi>Euripedes.</hi> I gave him a brief relation of <hi>Atalanta</hi>'s misfortunes and my own, whereby he ſaw what intereſt I had in the child, and entring into a very near league of friendſhip, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him and the fair <hi>Amenia</hi> into the <hi>Iſſick</hi> gulf. He gave me direction to find <hi>Marinus</hi> (which name he kept for the impoſers ſake) and with wonderfull expreſſion of his amity, he left me to go and redeem the child, which by a miracle, fortune once more gave me.</p>
                  <p>I haſted back to my fortreſs, and from thence to the place where <hi>Euripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> had left <hi>Marinus:</hi> I found him, redeem'd him, and brought him back to the fort, he was ſo well grown for thoſe few years, that I ſhould ſcarce have believ'd it to be the ſame child that the ſtorm had rapt from me, had not the ſemblance of his mother, and theſe tokens which were yet preſerv'd, that were loſt with him, ſufficiently teſtified it. It was a long time before I could get from the Pyrates, ſo loth were they to part with me, but at laſt I effected it through my continual importunities and deſires, and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Lixus</hi> with <hi>Marinus,</hi> I diſcovered my ſelf to my friends, and was
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51633:85"/> welcom'd with as great kindneſs as the ſence of former obligations, and a ſtrict amiry could work in generous ſouls. I was forc'd to make my ſelf known but to few; and thoſe whom I knew, neither the power of gold, nor the ſea of ruine, could have any power upon to induce to prodite me, for fear of the implacable h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of <hi>Atalanta</hi> ſo often dejected me, that had not the care, education, and protection of her Image, put a neceſſity upon me of living, I believe I had not reacht theſe dayes. <hi>I</hi> made it my duty and delight to give him all the education both in literature and arms that others of his rank uſ'd to learn; which he receiv'd with a nature propenſe to the higheſt attainments, and prov'd ſo good a proficient in both, that he was equally lov'd and admir'd of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>We endured this reſtraint with a vertue which we made out of neceſſity, near five years, when on a ſudden and unexpected by us our priſon dores were broke open, and we carried to the head of an armie of thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men to be their guides and conductors againſt <hi>Marcipſius.</hi> This was occaſioned through the evill reign of my brother and the diſcontents of his ſubjects, and the great a verſion they allwayes had to him, ſo that many, and that of the cheif about him, conſpireing together procured, this revolt, and raiſed this army with great ſecreſy in his further provinces. They had not kept our impriſonment ſo cloſe but that 'twas known to ſome of theſe, who knowing who I was deſign'd me preſently for his ſucceſſor, and for their Generall.</p>
                  <p>They made very large remonſtrances to me of the equity of their doings, the wickedneſſe of their King, and the affection they had to have me ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Ambition and injury both at once ſolicited me, but remembring that he was my brother and King <hi>I</hi> told them, As <hi>I</hi> would not approve of the follies and weakneſſe of their King, ſo I could not tell how to take
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51633:86"/> armes againſt a brother and a Prince whom <hi>I</hi> ought to obey, <hi>I</hi> told them that the Quallity of a brother prohibited me revenge, and that of a King ſwallow'd up all Injures. And that what before I had acted againſt him was not for injuries done to my ſelf, but being bound by the obligations of love, greater then thoſe of Nature <hi>I</hi> was forced to what I did, and haveing ſufficiently compenſated for that, I could not revenge injuries done to my ſelf.

Let me give you this proof of my affection, and ſhew you how ſenſible I am of injuries done you, and that for my ſake ſuffer me to make my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acknowledge me for his ſon by force, and when it lyes in our power to uſe mercy, <hi>I</hi>'le make him give ſatisfaction for injuries done to the beſt and cheifeſt of my fathers (and then we'l put on the duty of a ſon, and begg pardon for our ſelves. Not to uſe any more of thoſe arguments he uſ'd to perſwade me, the Love I bore him and the diſcretion I perceiv'd in thoſe young yeares ty'd me to him inſeparably and made me to accompany him in the warr, which laſted long and was very Tragicall. This war continued five years in which time we had many great battels, many ſlain, towns taken, Cities and places diſmantelled, houſes burnt, the country forraged, and all thoſe ſad diſaſters which inſeparably follow a civill war. The three firſt years victory ſtill attended us, and a ſenſible ſucceſſe made us doubt of nothing that might croſſe us.

Both ſides were very reſolute and fought it out to the laſt man, at leaſt thirty thouſand fell on both ſides, and the plain was like a ſea of blood the contrary ſide prov'd victors, <hi>Marinus</hi> was ſlain cover'd over all with wounds, falling upon a rampart of dead bodies that he had ſlain. My ſelf kill'd in <hi>Marinus</hi> and having loſt all the blood in my body fell amongſt the dead. But being preſerv'd againſt my will by thoſe that came to gain by the dead, and cur'd of my wounds <hi>I</hi> left <hi>Africa,</hi> With the like ſorrow that I left <hi>Spain</hi> after the death of <hi>Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanta.</hi> I retired amongſt thoſe Pirates that <hi>I</hi> once commanded, and the love

Underſtanding the deſign he was going about, and agreeing ſo fit to my wiſhes and deſires, I joyned my ſelf with him and ever ſince have been his companion in this beloved grot. <hi>I</hi> have given you the relation of my life with which fortune hath as often play'd as any, and hath made it one of the greateſt examples of her mutability. <hi>I</hi> cannot but wonder what kind of deity it is, that ſhould take ſo much delight in the viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes of things, being a matter of impoſſibillity for her to permit any man to enjoy a content that is permanent, nor is ſhe to be won by ſacryfices, prayers or vows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lonoxia</hi> thus concluding; <hi>Argelois</hi> ſtai'd ſome time reflecting on the many remarkable paſſages of his ſtory: But at laſt taking hold of the ſhutting up of his narration, ſpake ſomething of that clauſion. <hi>I</hi> have (ſaid he) given good at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to your narration, wherein there are many things worthy of denota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and wherein that Goddeſſe you ſpeak of hath manifeſted her power. But (if you pleaſe) I'le tell you the opinion of a philoſopher (whoſe dictates I well remember ſince I learn'd them in the <hi>Academian</hi> ſhades) concerning this <hi>Fortune,</hi> which thought it may be different from the Common opinion, ſeems not to deviate from reaſon, nor to be diſſentaneous to truth. The common ſort of people are conſtantly ignorant of the true notion of the Gods, and meaning of thoſe figures which they ſee repreſented to their eyes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fram'd by the hands of men; and only follow the vulgar opinions, and common notions and dogma's, teſtifying their obedience to receive upon truſt, what the prieſts or the wiſe men tell them, fitted to their Jgnorance, without any Inſpection into myſteries. So it is then that the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other nations, worſhip thoſe Images whether of <hi>Jove, Cyllenius, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus, Fortune,</hi> or any of the Gods as if they themſelves appeared, or their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinities were comprehended within thoſe materialls, when to confute that blindeſſe we often ſee them abuſed by ſacrilegious perſons without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction or puniſhment. The wiſe men themſelves were the cauſe firſt of all of this infulſe and falſe adoration; for they knowing how fraile the comprehenſions of vulgar minds were, and that they were not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive beyond the power or dictates of their ſenſes; nor comprehend a deity that is the Inviſible Gubernator of all things, fram'd certain Images, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the power, and different effects of one ſole powerfull <hi>Numen;</hi> that by thoſe ocular demonſtrations, ſitted to the abject capacities of the vulgar,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51633:87"/> they might be put in minde of a ſupream, inviſible, all-ruling power, leſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they might fall into an Impiety to believe there was no ſuch Power: or at leaſt ſhould be unmindfull of it without ſome thing formed to the ſenſe to mind them of it, and help forward their devotion, ſeeing that things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the eye immediately ſtirs up our rememberance, and cauſes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing or commemoration of thoſe things we had forgot. But of this their good intention there ſprung up a great Impiety, for the vulgar placeing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity in thoſe carved and gilded Images, adored them for that uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able power, and impoſing certain names, and offices on them, never look beyond thoſe wooden objects. And ſince for their confirmation, through the covetouſneſſe, (and to the enriching) of their prieſts or conſervers, ſome wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men adding ſorcery and charmes, cauſed certain illuſive miracles to be done or ſhown by theſe Images. But this error is too inveterate to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted, or ſpoken againſt; and ſo generally embraced, that very few of the wiſeſt Philoſophers have preſerved this verity. But he that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed me in theſe things (wiſer than the inſpired <hi>Sybills</hi> who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated by this power, and prophefied of ſome glorious ſtar, which is about this time to appear, that ſhall diſpel theſe clouds of error and impiety) hath them out of writings, that he accounts as ſacred, as others the <hi>Delphick</hi> oracle, and delivered them to me as his choyceſt ſecreets, and greateſt proof of his Love.</p>
                  <p>But to this <hi>Fortune</hi> you ſpeak of, a power or Goddeſſe that is accounted ſo caprichious and unſtable, the <hi>Romans</hi> according to their apprehenſions of her by her effects, have depicted her and plac'd her in the <hi>Pantheon</hi> in the form of a woman, 'cauſe that ſex is moſt mutable, faining her the daughter of the ſea, to ſhew her inconſtancy; and the ſervant of the Gods, becauſe they accounted all ſublunary things to be at her diſpoſe, and to be effected by her. She was placed upon a globe, to ſhew ſhe praeſided over the earth. She had <hi>Cornucopiae</hi> in one hand, to ſhew ſhe gave plenty; in the other a wheele, to ſhew the mutability of it, on which was the Image of <hi>Favour</hi> of a vitreous ſubſtance, apt to be broken and loſt. She was alſo painted blinde, and drawn by 4 blind horſes, they accounted her ſo by reaſon of the indifferency of her actions, in ſparing neither the princes nor the plebeians as <hi>Justice</hi> is, and by reaſon of her confuſed and miſcellaneous actions, which ſeem'd a <hi>Chaos</hi> in their eyes, and the productions of a blind deity. But this, (ſaid my tutor) is but the Phantaſies of thoſe that cannot perceive the great Divinity who rules all things, and by his providence effects all this that they atribute falſly to <hi>Fortune,</hi> a blinde Goddeſſe indeed: Nor are we able to comprehend this power; for what we think diſorderly and confuſed is moſt regular and agreeing, as we ſee in ſome <hi>Machine</hi> or clock whoſe wheeles move contrary wayes yet all in an exquiſet harmony and order, ſo may the actions of this providence (which are not contingent to it ſelf, becauſe it knoweth and foreſeeth what will come to paſſe, and all things come to paſſe that he foreſees, though no neceſſity be impoſ'd on contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent things) ſeem to be confuſed and without order, but there is nothing effected without Harmony and Concinnity, and that happens which he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beſt, and moſt convenient for his creatures, though their irregular thoughts may Judg other ways, and exclame againſt a power (through a falſe noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that doth nothing but what is good. For though ſome (being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the incomprehenſible wiſdom) wonder at the contrarity of things which bring about like effects, and variety of things which bring ofttimes contrary effects according to the innate diſpoſition or order of things, or men, as we may ſee that riches may make this man vicious, poverty may do the like by another. Proſperity and Fortune may make ſome careleſs of a good name, and conſcience. Proſperity and Fortune may make others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51633:87"/> to keep (and exhibit the greater) virtue. So that, that incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Gubernator that ſeems ſo inſtable to us, is moſt ſtable in reſpect of himſelf: And who ſeems blind unto us, ſees perſpicually, and orders all things according to the good of his Creatures, as beſt knowing, what is beſt for them; and beſt agreeing to their conſtitutions, for were there no adverſity we could have no ſence of pleaſure in proſperity. Therefore raile no more againſt <hi>Fortune</hi> in adverſity, for in ſo doing, you ſpeak againſt a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that knows what beſt befits you, and is moſt convenient for you; but learn to be content with whatſomever ſtate or condition ſhall betide you, and think that to be moſt convenient for you. Theſe were the words of my good Tutor (and the ſcholar of <hi>Cratippus</hi>) who lov'd me and enrich'd me with the fruits of his labours.</p>
                  <p>At this inſtant <hi>Euripedes</hi> entred the room, and ſo diverted <hi>Lonoxia</hi>'s reply, The time is inſenſibly elapſed (ſaid he) ſince you firſt entred into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I am come to do the ſame office for you <hi>Lonoxia,</hi> as you did for me yeſterday in the grove. I could not ſatisfy the naturall appitite of the body in turning over my books, neither do <hi>I</hi> beleive your diſcourſes to be more efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. I have been hearing (reply'd <hi>Lonoxia</hi>) the opinion of an <hi>Athenian</hi> philoſopher concerning our religion, which if true, makes the better part, and the moſt knowing, of the world, fools, and Idolaters. <hi>Argelois</hi> is as much againſt <hi>fortune</hi> as you againſt <hi>Love,</hi> both blind deities and incompet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but let's not innovate any thing here, for they are both baniſh'd our Cell. But let us go take ſome refection if you pleaſe for <hi>I</hi> doubt <hi>I</hi> have done <hi>Argelois</hi> great injury in detaining him ſo long, and you as great in robbing you of his company. Both returning his complement in very handſome termes they followed a ſervant that came to give them notice that dinner attended them. After they had taken that repaſt wherein temperance ſhew'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſtate, <hi>Argelois</hi> of a ſudden as't were coming out of a dream, and riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up from the place where he ſat.

Give me leave generous fathers to pay what <hi>I</hi> owe to my friends and my ſelf. <hi>I</hi> promiſe you to viſit you oft, and ſome other time to ſatisfy you in what you may deſire to know of me, and ſhall account my ſelf happy if I may have an occaſion to employ my life in your ſervice. <hi>Euripides</hi> ſmiling at his paſſion, well wee'l detain you no longer (ſaid he) I ſee you are not able to take warning by others harms, your paſſion is too ſtrong to be converted, but I am ſo zelous that I muſt needs repreſent to you the evills of this paſſion, and give you ſome argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for my averſion, but it ſhall be in the grove, where you may have the libery to leave me when you pleaſe. Well wee'le hear what you have to ſay (reply'd <hi>Argelois</hi>) and <hi>I</hi> make no queſtion but <hi>Love</hi> will inſpire his champion with words to defend him. <hi>Argelois</hi> taking his leave of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxia</hi> with abundance of obligatory ſpeeches followed <hi>Euripedes</hi> out of the grote, and walking to the place where he firſt encountered <hi>Euripedes</hi> they ſat down on a pleaſant banke, under the covert of the thickeſt trees, come adverſarie (ſaid <hi>Argelios</hi> ſmiling) let's hear what you have to ſay againſt love. <hi>Euripedes</hi> after a very little pauſe began thus.</p>
                  <p>I might well declame againſt Love if it were for no other thing but for the evills I have acquired by it, ſo that I know it not altogether by oppinion, but experience tells me it is evill, and all the effects of it evill. And on
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51633:88"/> my ſide are thoſe whom we terme Philoſophers and ſearchers out of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who knowing both the cauſes and the effects, have found this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion vitious and full of abſurdities, and have given it moſt worthily the name of deteſtable and inſipient, and thoſe enviegled with it, fools and Mad-men. <hi>I</hi> know this is too corroſive in the preſence of ſo ſtrong a lover, but I know your generous ſoule will give me leave, without adulation to ſpeak my minde freely, and take it as the effect of my love and affection that I deſire the ſame good to you as to my ſelfe, and that I cannot ſee another occupy that which is become odious to my ſelf. And though I know that it is almoſt impoſſible by naturall reaſon, and the exhibition of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo perſpicuous truths to perſwade any from his paſſion, eſpecially when it hath fixed its roots in the breaſt, and ſpread it ſelfe in the branches of deſires: yet I will exhibit to you the reaſons I have to hate this paſſion, beeing an evill, and therefore worthy to be hated. But before I ſhew the evil of't, I muſt confeſſe that love placed in ſome generous ſoules who can command this paſſion, not to be evill, but then, as (I think) I told you yeſterday, that it is not a paſſion, but ſome extention of the ſoul, which it can continue or withdraw at pleaſure. But this that I ſpeak of is evill of it ſelfe though it may be more or leſſe perſpicuable according to the generoſity and baſeneſſe, the purity or impurity, of ſuch ſouls that it is placed in: to ſhew this to you, according to the weakneſſe of my capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, I will begin firſt with the cauſe of this paſſion. I omit to ſpeake of Love in generall, whether of naturall, and ſimpathizeing <hi>Love,</hi> or Love proceeding from ſimilitude of qualities, or manners, or of morall love ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, or particular to men, or naturall to children, or parents, all whoſe cauſes are indifferent, and beſides that paſſion on which I inſiſt, and which cannot be without diverſity of ſex as the other may. But the cauſe of this (as generally the chiefe cauſe of all love) is an attractive power, which cauſeth an expanſion, or emotion, of the ſoule and ſpirits to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which ſhe thinks convenient for her, and which muſt be a conception of need, or want of the object. Now privation it ſelfe is evill, and love being privation and want of an object; is therefore evill; for the effect of it beeing deſire, ſeeks the poſſeſſion of that object, and ſo makes the love circular, to attract that to the ſoule which ſhe ſeemes to want; Now if we then wanted nothing we ſhould not deſire any thing, which ſhewes we are not compleat in our ſelves, and deſire being the exhibition of want, and the effect of love, ſhews that the foundation it ſelf is evill, for that it is grounded on want. Then beſides if you look upon the outward cauſe of attraction, whether it be beauty, or any other exterior quality of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject beloved, and the poſſeſſion of it deſired, (which is alwayes ſuffulted with hope) the very cauſes themſelves being vanity or not worthy objects for the ſoules egreſſion to, or opperation upon, that deſire, and that love cannot be good, the cauſes themſelves being not abſolutely good, but vain and tranſitory. But this by the way, the chief thing I propoſed was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on the effects of this paſſion, which plainly exhibit the evils of it, and out of which as from the fountains head, all other evill paſſions have ſprung. This alſo we may conſider in relation to the body, and to the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Firſt conſider this in relation to the body, and that muſt be relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as it is joyned with other paſſions? whoſe motions cauſe the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of motions in the body. Through this the body, which is as it were the caſe of the ſoul, is imbued, through the conjunction of the ſoule with the body; with pain, with languiſhing, with reſtleſſeneſs, and all the ſenſs feel the effects of this paſſion upon the ſoul, by expoſing the body to danger by wounds, by torments and oft times by death, all which happen through
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51633:88"/> the exuſcitation of other paſſions. Now the ſoule ſuffers innumerable evills for firſt all paſſions, as griefe, hatred, envie, wrath, malice, revenge, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and divers other particular paſſions which ſpring from this love, all which falling upon the body, agitate it to diverſity of motions, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſt cauſes the ſoule to a continuall ſolicitous care of obtaining, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of its deſires, which if once hope faile, then diſpair the foretunner of miſchiefe, carries the ſoule into wonderful precipitancies, and if in its beſt eſtate, that hope continues, it is never without fear, jealouſie, and a ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>icitrous care of conſerving the object of its love; ſo that the ſoul is under a continuall agitation by thoſe pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But now to leave this kind of <hi>Philoſphicall</hi> diſcourſe, let us ſpeake of it morally, and let us conſider the evill effects it hath produced in the world: and then we will define it thus. <hi>Love</hi> is a moſt fatall plague, a moſt venemous poyſon, a moſt ardent and fooliſh deſire, and the ſource and fountaine of all evill.

And beſides all theſe folly, luſt, ſinne, doings, turbulent motions, and precipitancies wait on lovers. And if we ſhould go about to ſumme up the bad conſequences and effects of this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion, with the evils it hath cauſed, we ſhould find them innumerable; for what diſturbances, what commotions, what hurly burlies, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, what battalls, what ſlaughtars hath it cauſed? and what rapes what ſinnes, what polutions, what ſueds, and what murthers hath it committed? was it not the cauſe of the diſtruction of ancient <hi>Troy?</hi> was it not the cauſe of the baniſhing Kings out of <hi>Rome?</hi> Was it not the cauſe of the aboliſhing the <hi>Decemveri?</hi> hath it not been the cauſe of many murders? was it not the cauſe of the wicked and inhumane ſlaughter of <hi>Abſyrtus</hi> the brother of <hi>Medea?</hi> was it not the loſſe of <hi>Megara</hi> when <hi>Niſus</hi> loſt his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hair by his daughter <hi>Scylla.</hi> Alas! it would be endleſſe to recount theſe things ſo well known, and generall hated, and yet this diſpicable unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and dangerous paſſion, cannot be ſhunned but embraced by thoſe who acknowledge the evills of it, but yet wilfully maintaine its intereſts: They cannot take example by others, nor ſhun the precipicies they ſee others fall into before their eyes, but that they alſo muſt ruſh into them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I ſee any good at all that this paſſion doth produce, but on the contrary thoſe that are free from it enjoy all the quiets, felicity, eaſe pleaſures, and freedome which the other are incapable of, and which is moſt miſerable of all, of free men, and unconſtrained, they become ſlaves, ſubjects, and bound to obey the motions of their owne paſſion; and will of an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate miſtris, who it may be is, as diſpicable in the unblinded eye of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as ſhe is lovely in his. Nor let it ſerve any to excuſe it by ſaying they are forced and cannot decuſſe it, for it is impoſſible for all men, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre this paſſion, if they reſolve to ſet their wills to doe it, but ſo long as they account it good and beſt for them, they are not able to overcome it, becauſe they doe not ſeek it truly, but cheriſh and obey every motion that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51633:89"/> cometh from it. But if they were once convinced of the evill of this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion and were reſolved to forſake it, <hi>I</hi> make no queſtion of the poſſibility of their effecting it. There may be divers wayes propoſed for the decuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or prevention of this evill, the chief of which as I ſuppoſe, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant imployment of the mind, either in ſtudy, or armes, whereby it may have no time to fall into that which (as they ſay) is accquired by a ſupine and idle life, fit to entertaine ſuch a gueſt, and juſtly ſent as a plague from the Gods to ſuch a ſoule. Other wayes may be taken, as they lye convenient to the perſon; but chiefly the diverting of the mind from thoughts which feed the fancie, and inflame the ſoul, and a ſeperation from the object, with an intention of the mind on ſome other thing, is the way to acquire a freedome from that ſlavery. I have given you free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my oppinion of this paſſion I have ſo well experienced, though indeed I enveigh not againſt it for the detrement <hi>I</hi> have receiv'd by it; but for that it ſeems to me evill in it ſelfe, and worthy of greater condemnation. I know (generous <hi>Argelios</hi>) that your generoſity will pardon this freedome of ſpeech, againſt that in which you are ſo intereſted. <hi>Argelios</hi> ſeeing he had concluded, return'd him an anſwer thus.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſpake for this paſſion becauſe I am immerged in it, thereby to juſtifie my ſelf or oppoſe your gravity, but becauſe I think it juſtifiable, therefore I will give you my poor conceptions of it. There is ſcarcely any thing here on the earth that is ſo pure, but that in it there may be found a commixion of droſſe, nothing ſo good, but in't there is retained ſome bad, and nothing ſo convenient, but it may have its diſcommodities. We muſt not be therefore all ſpiders to extract the poyſon and leave the virtue, by that means we ſhall make every thing odious and abhorrible. But we muſt as well denote the good as the evill, the benefit as the diſcomodity of this paſſion, and then you will ſee the ballance prepond on my ſide. The laſt night I gave you ſome touches, as I was able, on the enormities of this paſſion, which was the only thing that was evill in it. But that I may anſwer ſo mething to what you have ſpoken againſt it (ſince you are pleaſed to let my weakneſs exhibit it ſelf) <hi>I</hi> will briefly touch upon what you have ſaid in order, and (as far as my memory will accommodate me) ſhew that you have only conſidered the evils and exhorbitancies of this paſſion, againſt which all thoſe wiſe men (you mention) of all ages have declamed, but the good it hath (and is able to) effect, you have omitted; it is againſt the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities that they have declared and not againſt the paſſion it ſelfe, which is neither good nor evill of it ſelfe, yet if it be as you ſay, it effects all evills generally, and is therefore to be condemned. But <hi>I</hi> will ſhew that it is as capable of effecting good as evill, and if I grant that evill is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it monly effected by, yet that is the fault of men, not of the thing. But to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer what you have ſaid, I will preſuppoſe that your goodneſſe will not be offended at what I ſhall deliver, and that you will think it, if I erre, to be the weakneſſe of my judgement and not the deſire of my will; and ſince truth is to be found out by oppoſition and diſcuſſion I hope it will be no pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to oppoſe my conceptions to yours. Firſt I muſt deny what you ſay, that this paſſion is evill of it ſelfe, which is the chiefe and main point.</p>
                  <p>For if we conclude ſo, then we muſt grant that all the paſſions of the ſoul are evill of themſelves, for they were all implanted in man at the ſame time, and they are ſimply of one nature, though different in effect; which thing cannot be conſentanious with the purity, and juſtice of the Gods, who created every thing good, for what is evill we acquire it of our ſelves or have it infuſed by evill <hi>genij,</hi> ſo that paſſions naturally are not evill but are made ſo by the uſe, (or rather the abuſe) of them. Now if you grant as
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51633:89"/> you cannot deny that the Gods created man good and pure, what you have ſaid to prove the evileneſſe of this paſſion is to no effect. For though this paſſion be conjoyned with <hi>deſire;</hi> which <hi>I</hi> grant is a token of need or want, yet that want is not evill of it ſelfe; for the <hi>Gods</hi> ſo created man, and made him not alone, and of himſelfe able to ſubſiſt; but indigent of ſome things. For if man wanted nothing he were <hi>God,</hi> for not to want is to be a creator, therefore that privation you ſpeake of is not evill, for to deſire (which you call the badge of the wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>) is as natural as to eat and drink and if to want be evill, then man is wholly evil, for he is made up of indigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and deſires.</p>
                  <p>In the next place you ſay that the objects of our love, and deſire, are not abſolutely good, ſo that the cauſes or foundations being evil or rotten, the effects or building cannot be good or found. I ſay as all outward objects (or any thing beſides the Love and beutitude of the Gods themſelves) are not abſolutely good, ſo are they not abſolutely evill, but relie on our uſe or abuſe of them. For beauty is not evill of it ſelfe, nor any outward accompliſhment, neither is it evill for us to deſire it, but the exceſſe or exorbitancy of deſire may make it evill, for if we do deſire that which we cannot have without detriment to another, or wrong to our ſelves, or too much exceed in our deſires, then it is evill. But when we bound them regularly they are not evill but may be uſed, but further, deſire of it ſelfe is good, for the only ſcope of it tends to the ſeeking of good (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion the eſchewing of evill) but now if our deſires are illuded by our judgements, or are guided by our ſenſe, and not truly placed by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings and will, then they are exorbitant and become evill, and we oftentimes deſire evills, not as evils, but (being illuded in our judgements) as good, for ſo they are repreſented to our underſtandings and embraced by the will. But now to the effects both upon body and ſoule <hi>I</hi> believe that I may parallel as much good that they receive by this paſſion to your evill. For as Love and hatred are the Springs from whence all paſſions ſlow, and receive a mixture of, ſo theſe evils which you recount ſtow not ſoly from them, but alſo thoſe paſſions or emotions of the ſoule which we call good, ſuch then is joy, eſtimation, generoſity, humility, magnanimity, hope, courage, boldneſſe, pity, compaſſion, good-will, gratitude, lightheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe and the like, all which ſerve as much to the comfort of ſoule and body, and thoſe you mention to the diſcomfort. But now to follow you into your morality where you conſider the evill effects proceeding from the exorbitancy, ſo I will only ballance and exhibit the good that follows the regularity. And firſt I will give it a contrary definition thus, regular <hi>Love</hi> is a plant ſprung from the Gods, which ſharpens virtue, quickens forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, produceth boldneſſe, makes ſmooth the rough, makes accute the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and opens a paſſage for all virtues. Love in its regularity cauſes men indeed to forſake their former rough hewen natures, and to become humane, it is as polliſhment to (or as a foil to ſet off the luſter of) ſtones: to ſuch it makes them become plyant, gentle, meek, humble, indues ſuch as enter its ſchool with loquacity, elegant ſpeech, quickens their obtuſe underſtandings, makes the ignorant to become wonderfull learned by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, fills the mouth of the ruſtick with complements, cauſes rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit inventions, helps to wiſdome, makes the ſoldier magnanimous, the coward valiant, the timorous fearleſſe, furthereth great archivements, it alſo excites bounty, liberality, patience and fortitude: and what indeed cannot the force, virtue, and power of love doe? for it oft times ſo tranſports nature that it makes her capable of effecting things that ſeem impoſſible, and puts ſuch vigor that it will adventure on any difficulties. It deſpiſeth all dangers, nay ſeeks to acquire them out of a hight of generoſity
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51633:90"/> to free the object beloved. It overcomes death not with a fooliſh precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie, but out of a ſetled reſolution, and joy, for the object it delighteth in. And though in the way to the end, there be many vexations and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles yet the enjoyment is thereby made more ſweet, and ſtrengthned the more by it, and recompences all troubles with it's deliciouſneſſe. Now to what you alledge concerning the effects of it in the world, how wicked and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable they have been I will grant you that it hath effected more evill than good, but this ariſeth from the evill and poyſenous nature of men, and muſt not be laid upon the paſſion, and though I grant what you inferre concerning its exorbitancy, you erre much to think this paſſion effects nothing good, and though I cannot cite ſo many and notorious examples as you may for the other, yet I know there are thoſe worthy of notation and reco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dation.</p>
                  <p>And againe as it hath been the occaſion of much ſtrife, ſo it hath been the cauſe of much concord, amity, peace and quietude. And is it not the greateſt ligament in the world to concord, when it joynes either ſex in the bands of <hi>Hymen?</hi> unites Kings, ſtates, Lords, and private men who are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and oppoſers of each other, and cauſes them to become friends and in amity? Is it not the chiefe effectriſs of life, when it attains the object of its deſire? We ſhould never be regular in our luſts if we were not in the bonds of Love, for that hinders the fancy from flying to diverſity, and cauſes an immoration on an object which it counts worthy of its emotions; ſo that it is the conſerver, and not the deſtroyer of government and good order.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude I ſay the only thing to reconcile us is to put that juſt difference between the paſſion ſimply, from whence all the good proceedes and the exorbitancy of it, whence all the evill proceeds. For in a pure ſoul it is like water in a Chriſtall glaſs, but in a polluted contaminated ſoul it is like clear water put into a polluted veſſel, whereby it becomes naught and good for nothing. And though I have ſaid it is a thing impoſſible to love without deſire of attaining, and enjoying, yet in ſome it is made not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed end, and doth not altogether partake of that brutality of luſt but is of a purer nature, not deſireing the uſe of the object, but to become one with it, to be incorporated with it, and not to take any thing from it, but to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge it ſelf in it, and very like the true love of friendſhip, wherein is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed all virtue, and where love is of a more celeſtiall nature, though that be not without deſire, of the good and of the welfare and continual preſence of the object; and this love to a different ſex may participate much of that of friendſhip, though it rarely is ſo perfect becauſe we deſire ſomething to our ſelves. But laſtly to the cloſe of your diſcourſe <hi>I</hi> am not clearly of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion which you inferre that this paſſion may be ſhun'd or diſcuſſed by labour and induſtry, by all. I grant that we may become maſters of it, and regulate it to our wills, and that time may ſlaken it or take it clean away in ſome, the mind exerciſeing its functions, and in difuſeing our love, on more generall objects; whereby it may be recalled from intention by expanſion and <hi>I</hi> believe that it may be long prevented by meanes, but that it may be decuſſed at pleaſure or that we may ſo prepare our ſelves as not to be agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by it, I cannot grant. For it is ſo ſuddenly cauſed that we have not time to fore-arme our ſelves, for ſometimes an exquiſite beauty, or other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject wherein we are ſurpriz'd with admiration, which cauſes deſire, which accompanied with hope, gaines a poſſeſſion ſuddenly, ſometimes it inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſlides into the heart, when through long converſation with an object natures ſympathizing through a ſimilitude of qualities, it is fixed in the breaſt, which innate Love growing to maturity, and furthered by deſire is hard to ſhake off, and almoſt impoſſible. And as you propoſed means for the ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, of this paſſion, ſo I ſay thoſe that are imbued with it, though they may
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51633:90"/> not have the power to decuſſe it, yet they may have this power (which the Gods in juſtice leaves them) not ſo abſolutely to give over their wills to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to be ruled by their own paſſion; for we may do the ſame thing in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and in judgment, and it ſhall be evil in the one, and not in the other, though it be not evill in the act but in the manner, for if we commit any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thing by the guidance of our paſſion only, without the examination of the underſtanding, and ordination of the will, it is evil: But when we do the ſame thing out of a clear Judgment that it ought to be ſo, and will it to be ſo, then we do it not out of paſſion but out of Judgment, ſo that the paſſion quickens the underſtanding when it gives it leave to work, and leads to precipitancy through obcaecation when it is guided by its own temerity. Therefore they muſt look to all exorbitant motions whatſomever, &amp; to the regulation of their deſires, and to the freedom of their will, though they have paſſion for their miſtreſſes, and then their virtues will be exerciſed, their graces will be exhibited, and their end will be glory. <hi>Argelois</hi> thus ended and <hi>Euripides</hi> ſmiling; I did not beleive (ſaid he) you had been ſo ſtrong in arguments for your paſſion, I thought you could better have deffended it with your ſword then by reaſon, but I ſee there is nothing wanting to your compleatment. I will no more differ with you, and if it be poſſible I'le make my ſelf believe you; however I will injure you no longer by keeping you from a happineſſe you ſo much eſteem, but let me deſire you to make my grote happy by your viſits ſo long as you reſide ſo near me, for other obligations I remit my ſelf into the armes of your generoſity. <hi>Argelois</hi> replyed with his wonted grace and ſweetneſſe, and promiſing him to viſit him as often as his paſſion and opportunity would give leave, they parted, <hi>Euripides</hi> returning to his grot, and <hi>Argelois</hi> returning from whence he came.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51633:92"/> nothing but virtue and generoſity, and to whom many accompliſh't beauties (ſtroke by the arrows of the <hi>Cyprian</hi> archer, and tipt with the flames of his eyes) had reno'red their devotions, though he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd to all as inſenſible, as he was was lovly. His looks participated much of the nature of the <hi>Caelicola</hi>'s, for all that beheld them ſaid they were Angelicall, in them appear'd a majeſty, ſo equally mix't with modeſty, that it made a kinde of an ocular harmony. His eyes black and ſparkling with vivacity (unleſſe clouded with melancholy) gave a kind of chearfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the beholders, and ſent ſparks of divine lightning into the ſouls of thoſe that converſ'd with him. His mouth (which when it dilated it ſelf into ſmils had a peculiar grace and pleaſant) was the ſeat of Eloquence, and the muſes cheifeſt grace. His complexion was more than ordinary fair for a man, yet thoſe that ſaw him could not by it judge him effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, if they did, the world could have juſtified the contrary by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious valour, his hair (of a brightiſh brown, and a great ornament to his face,) was ſomething long, and making a kinde of <hi>Meanders</hi> which caſt themſelves naturally into fair curles, which at that time the wanton winde playing with, as he walked, had caſt backward upon his ſhoulders. It had been a thing wonderfull, if ſo fair a caſe ſhould not contain a rich and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Jewel, and that nature had prepar'd ſo rair a peice to contain an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſoul. But ſo great imbelliſhment of nature was made for a ſoul, which partak'd wholy of the eſſence of the gods, and rarified from the droſſe of the world carried in it much divinity.</p>
               <p>The quickneſſe of his wit was unexpreſſable, both for comprehenſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and briefly, there was nothing requiſet or capeable for a mortall man to acquire but was ſeated in him, and which he could uſe without oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or affectation, his ſoul being made of the pureſt ſubſtance was imbued with the heav'nlyeſt accompliſhments. In fine he was the mirror of courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and the moſt accompliſh'd darling of nature. This <hi>Heroe</hi> viſſibly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with all the graces and virtues that attended him, and with a pace alltogether Majeſtick continued his muſings, till ſummon'd by the noyſe of certain voyces he was exuſcitated out of the depth of his thoughts. Caſting up his eyes which till then had ben fix'd on the grownd, he perceiv'd he had not taken the direct way to the Caſtle, but the oblique path which he had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed had brought him to the further ſide of the park adjoyning to the Caſtle, at which place was a poſterne, which over an arched bridge of ſtone gave an introition into the <hi>Vivarium.</hi> Hearing the noyce to approach towards the enterance of the park he abſcur'd himſelf behind the ſallows that grew on the ſide of a little hill that circundated the park. Caſting his eyes towards the poſterne he ſaw that 't was the incomparable <hi>ELIANA</hi> who attended, with her maides and her old conſervator the good <hi>Tribulus</hi> had left the Caſtle to refreſh themſelves with the air of the pleaſant evening.</p>
               <p>The bright lamp of the day then declining, had painted the sky with bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing roſes, and with a ſerenity envited them to that ambulation. <hi>Argelois</hi> was preſently ſtricken with a chilling tremor through every part, and with a fear uſuall to Lovers, had no power to ſtir or move any part of his body at that unexpected ſight. But his eyes fix't intentively on that amazing beauty they avidouſly devour'd her perfections, being allmoſt ſtarv'd by that ſmall abſence.</p>
               <p>I lack the pen of <hi>Thalia,</hi> to give you here a diſcription of that matchleſſe <hi>Eliana.</hi> Supply my defects with your thoughts, and imagin her more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick then <hi>Saturnia</hi> the Queen of Heaven, more faire than the <hi>Paphian</hi> Queen, more learn'd than <hi>Minerva,</hi> more chaſt than the <hi>Delian</hi> Goddeſſe and of better utterance than the <hi>Graces</hi> and the <hi>Muſes,</hi> and you will not ſurpaſſe the hight of her perfections. I'le endeavour to give you ſome
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51633:92"/> ſmall libament of them, though they will exceed whatſoever I am able to utter. Not to trouble you with the clothing and garniſhing of her body, (which gave rather aluſter to her clothes and ornaments) they were befitting the ſeaſon of the ſpring, and anſwerable to the qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of a Princeſſe. Her pace and port was full of Majeſty, and her very ſhaddow ſeemed to have ſomthing worthy of Courting. Had you ſeen her going, you might have obſerved the <hi>Graces</hi> meaſuring forth her ſteps, and the germinating graſs aſpiering to kiſſe her feet, and as if it had taken life by that gentle compreſſion, to raiſe its tender head with more vigor. Her ſtature was taller than ordinary women, her body ſlender an of an even make, and every part in ſo juſt a ſymmetry and perfect har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that nature ſeemed to excell her ſelf, and to exhibit this peice of hers only to gain her admiration and devotion. Her hair which was bound up under a caule made of ſilke and ſet with precious ſtons, ſhewed its brigtneſſe through the Cutts of the net-worke, and her locks naturally curling, hung in ſo comly (yet careleſſe) order, as if the <hi>Graces</hi> had beſtowed that day in compoſing their mode. Her countenance, which at the ſame time carried, the Majeſty of <hi>Juno,</hi> the fairneſſe of <hi>Venus</hi> and the modeſty of <hi>Diana,</hi> could not but ſtrik with wonder and aſtoniſhment, whatſoever eyes dared to offer ſo great proſanation as to behold ſo divine an object. All that was of raire and admirable eſteem in the moſt famous beauties of the world, were at once to be found in the face of <hi>Eliana,</hi> So that there was no part thereof but ſhewed perfections enough to raviſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Souls. But her eyes, which had enkendled thouſands of flames, and where the <hi>Paphian</hi> Lad kept an arcenal of arrows, were ſo command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they inſpired unuſuall chaſtity into the ſouls of her adorers, and gave vertue to thoſe ſhafts which he ſhot thence unwillingly, to cauſe flames of wonder and adoration. One glance of thoſe luminaries killed all exorbitant deſires and unchaſt thoughts, and made her beholders think it the greateſt ſacriledg to have any praved thoughts of ſuch divinity. In them ſhone ſo great ſeverity, but yet mixt with ſo pleaſing a grace, that it cauſed deſire and fear at the ſame inſtant, and confounded them that were taken with their lovelineſs, with fear and trembling at their Majeſty. There is no ſimily whereby we may repreſent her complection, or any thing in the world compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it. The skies has ſome little ſemblance, when the glorious lamp of light, gives us warning of his appearance; by the crimſon bluſhes of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is too common to compare her lipps to corall, or call them crimſon cherries, let it ſuffice to tell you they were the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million portalls, within which were lock'd a treaſure of pearles, and through which proceaded the fragrancies of the happy <hi>Arabia,</hi> and by which the <hi>graces</hi> form'd words raviſhingly ſweet and charming; happy in their own kiſſes, and too divine for any others compreſſion. All the reſt of her face was a like raviſhing, and you would never with draw your eyes, but for the charmes of her neck and breaſts; the one proud of its portage exalted it ſelf, and was compaſſed about with pearls, which ſeemed foyles, and diamonds which were umbrella's to the ſurpaſſing whiteneſſe of her skin; the other, half covered with a carbaſeous gorget, ſwelled yet like two ſmall mountains of new fallen ſnow, in the beholding of which, a man muſt have loſt all his ſenſes, if he had not found fires injected inviſibly, from thoſe niveous tumors, and not loſt himſelf abſolutly, in deeper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations. All this is but the ſhaddow of that ſoul lock'd up in this incomparable ſtructure, and which had carried her through her miſſeries
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51633:93"/> with ſuch wonderfull wiſdom and deportment. Her wit was correſpondent to ſo noble a birth, and the greatneſſe of her ſoul was ſeen by all that converſed with her, her ſpeeches were delivered with ſuch aptitude, and vivacity, and with ſo much wit and readineſſe, that they carried as many charms as her beauty and ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ror of beauty, the choſeſt peice <hi>Nature</hi> ever brought to light, the beloved of the Gods, and on whom they had beſtowed more gifts than ever they gave <hi>Pandora,</hi> and whoſe peer was not to be found in the univerſe, to whom by right all hearts ought to bow, and acknowledg themſelves her vaſſells eternally. This was the object on whom <hi>Argelois</hi> ſpent ſo many thoughts, and who had clearly depriv'd him of every thing but a will to ſerve her. He ſtod along time inſenſible, and as if he had been nail'd to one of the fallows did nothing but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her with his eyes, till at laſt a row of thick growing Cypreſſes enviouſly deprived him of his further pleaſure.</p>
               <p>When that ſhe was vaniſhed from the eyes of his body, he yet held her fixt before thoſe of his mind, but at laſt coming to himſelf, he left his ſtation and croſſing a little wood, that he might not be noted to come from the Caſtell, he met her at the end of the walke. <hi>Eliana</hi> was not ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſee him, for the graces wherewith ſhe was indued, ſympathizing with his vertues knew what it was to want ſo good company, ſo little time, and ſhe muſt have have been altogether blind if ſhe had not ſeen his noble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments to have ſurpaſſ'd the greateſt births of that age, and inſenſible, if through complacenſy ſhe had not affected his company. <hi>Argelois</hi> after congy done to his viſible Goddeſſe, had ſpoke, but that ſhe thus preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him. Sir (ſaid ſhe) we were fearfull that you had abandoned us, or that your melancholy had carried you unto ſome precepice, but I ſee now that it was the will of the Gods, by this ſmall abſence to give us a taſt of our miſſeries if we ſhould looſe you, and to make us the better to reſent your company, whilſt they give us that happineſſe of conſerving you here. The Prince is gon himſelf to ſeek you, but whilſt he ſearches the words, favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fortune makes me find you. Maddam (reply'd <hi>Argelois</hi>) you might well think that melancholy had carried me into the moſt inconſiderate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice that could be, if I had forgon wilingly ſo great a happineſſe as I receive by your ſight. The Gods cannot give me a greater heaven than what <hi>I</hi> find in your preſence. You may be ſure that thoſe moments I have been detain'd from you, ſeem'd years in my fight, and that I had not been ſo ſong abſent but for ſome extraordinary accident. <hi>I</hi> am very ſorry (went he on) that the Prince by my abſence ſhould be engaig'd to this inveſtigation, I would (if it were lawfull) accuſe him of inconſiderateneſs for leaving a divinity to ſeek ſuch an object as my ſelf. Your virtues (reply'd <hi>Eliana</hi>) are to be priz'd more than ſo; all the content we are able to give you, is below their deſerts. All the duty we are able to perform (return'd <hi>Argelois</hi>) to that goodneſſe wherewith you are indued, is far below what it ought to be, and <hi>I</hi> eſteem thoſe unworty to Live that acknowledg not, that the Gods gave us lives but to protect the perfect Images of themſelves. <hi>Trebulus</hi> interrupting their diſcourſe ſhew'd them the Prince <hi>Dardanus</hi> who having returned to the Caſtle and not finding <hi>Eliana</hi> there was come to meet them. <hi>Fonteius Argelois's</hi> ſquire firſt ſeing his maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not ſtaying for the Prince (with whom he had been to find him) ran before and falling on his knees embraced his maſters, as if he had been abſent many years, expreſſing the ardency of his affection, by the manner of his action. By that time he was got free from the embraces of his ſquire, he met with thoſe of his friend, the prince, who claſping him about the middle, and

Yet in his heart he was glad that fortune had made uſe of that occaſion wherein he might engage his life for her ſafe-guard, The danger ſhe was in was ſo emminent that he had no time to draw his ſword, but not regarding his life, with his open armes he ſlung himſelfe between the open mouth of the Bear, and <hi>Eliana,</hi> who at the ſame inſtant fell being out of breath, and affrighted.

               <p>They ſpent an hower in this ſadneſſe together, interjecting ſometimes ſuch ſad ejaculations, when at laſt there came one to <hi>Dardanus</hi> to tell him his ſiſter had recovered that fit, but for that ſhe was weary by reaſon of her jorney ſhe had betaken her ſelfe to a repoſe, and had ſent him ſome letters from the King and Queen to peruſe in the mean time. <hi>Dardamus</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing read the letters to himſelfe, but for that he uſed not to keep the leaſt thought from his dear <hi>Argelois,</hi> he gave them him to read, who ſound there a new and a great addition of trouble, inſomuch that letting them fall out of his hand, he fell backward on a bed by which he ſtood. <hi>Dardanus</hi> not imagining the true caſe of this ſudden alteration imputed it to the trouble that formerly agitated him, and ſo applyed his ſpeeches to comfort him.

They continued ſuch like diſcourſes a long time, but the chiefeſt cauſe of <hi>Argelois</hi> his ſudden paſſion at that time was the contents of the Kings letter, which was that he charged <hi>Dardanus</hi> to acquire the good likeing of <hi>Eliana</hi> with all the ſpeed he could, and that he had wrote to <hi>Tribulus</hi> to haſten his deſires, and upon whoſe word he was preparing things in a readineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of his <hi>Hymenean,</hi> triumph.

That night was ſpent in moſt ſad agitations, which were the foretun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a wonderfull melancholy, ſighs preſt to be emitted, and the haſt of the one impeded the paſſage of the other. But thoſe, nor the pitifull complaints he made, could give any caſe to his troubled ſoul. <hi>Dardanus</hi> viſited him in the morning before he left his chamber, and underſtanding that he had not reſted well that night, he feared leſt his wound might have hindred his repoſe, but that being look'd upon, they found it almoſt well, and <hi>Dardanus</hi> conſidering that that was not the cauſe of thoſe ſad characters he read in his face, he found the true ſympathy that is between friends. He ſpent more words in comforting him, than ever he did in courting <hi>Eliana,</hi> though he accounted her worthy of the Love of the greateſt monarck. He found no paſſion for any but for the good of his friend, whom he loved far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than himſelf. That morning they renewed their viſits to the two princeſſes, and <hi>Panthea</hi> having fortified her ſelf, ſhewed but little alteration at that time. <hi>Dardanus</hi> having drawn aſide <hi>Eliana</hi> to the window, where he obey'd his fathers inſtructions, and let her ſee that he was indued with all thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were requiſite for his birth.

               <p>That ſtrange fire of Love burnt ſo inlie the heart of <hi>Argelois,</hi> that at laſt its hidden flames began to appear in the pale aſhes of his face, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to others the torments he ſuffer'd ſo ſecreetly.

This was but ſmall comfort to <hi>Argelois,</hi> who found cruciations in every word, yet endured the torments becauſe they came from his friend. I know none (ſaid he ſighing) that is worthy of the faire and virtues <hi>Eliana,</hi> but your ſelfe, and I admire that ſhe can be inſenſible of all thoſe charmes which accompany you, and which are enough to allure (the whole world to your obedience. Modeſty muſt be found in maidens, and it is out of a pudicity, and deſire of being courted, that makes her ſeeme ſo negligent of that which ſhe moſt deſires. you are a good Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of her thoughts (reply'd <hi>Dardanus</hi> ſmiling) but ſhall I beleive the like by you, and take your words to be contrary to your deſires, if ſo, my ſiſter were happy after all her torments. My Lord ſaid <hi>Argelois,</hi> I cannot heare thoſe termes, ſaid <hi>Dardanus,</hi> it is contrary to the law of our contracted friendſhip, you put me in minde of them when you ſpeak of the princeſſe <hi>Panthea,</hi> (replyed <hi>Argelois</hi>) or elſe the tranſports of that Love you honor me with, would make you utterly forget what <hi>I</hi> am, and make my ſelfe unmindfull of my own condition. Love (reply'd <hi>Dardanus</hi>) is not to be limmited to lawes, it reſpects perſons more than conditions, you cannot but be aſſured that her Love is intire, and you know that her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicity would not have let her diſcovered the torments of a ſmall flames they are unuterable and unexpreſſable, were you ſenſible of the <hi>Cyprian</hi> torment yout ſelf, you would at leaſt pitty another. <hi>Argelois</hi> could not refrain from ingemminated ſighs at thoſe words, but fearing he might diſcover himſelfe by their continuation. I am not (ſaid he) ſo inſenſible of the princeſſes trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of that trouble which you impute to me the cauſe, but that I have wiſhed my ſelfe a thouſand times of a birth ſufficient to ſatisfie her deſires, and it is only for her ſake that I deny my ſelfe ſo great a happineſſe, it may be others would not be of my mind but <hi>I</hi> cannot doe ſo great an injury to a princeſſe and the ſiſter of <hi>Diadanus</hi> as to compare my baſeneſſe, to her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. This might and ſhould have been remedied at the firſt (if I am the cauſe) by my abſceſſion, but your commands made me ſtay to her detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you know that this removall was chiefly for that end, that ſhe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51633:96"/> might forget that ſight that was ſo fatall to her, and now ſhe is come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are the only ſoliciter of her ſute. Alas! give leave that I may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die or depart, rather than be the tormenter of ſo good and faire a ſoul or yeild to that conjunction which would be contrary to the will of the King and diſgracefull to the princeſſe and your ſelf. I'le ſpeak no more of it dear <hi>Argelois</hi> (ſaid <hi>Dardanus</hi>) ſince it is ſo contrary to you, yet give me leave to admire the greatneſſe of that ſoule that can deny a happineſſe with ſo much generoſity. Such like diſcourſes had theſe two perfect friends when occaſion gave leave. <hi>Panthea</hi> in the mean time ſuffered all thoſe torments incedent to deſpareing lovers, which were the more augmented by that engagement that lay upon her to hide her from the eyes of <hi>Eliana,</hi> and by ſuppreſſing thoſe ordinary allevaments of a love ſick heart, leaſt her aboundance ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her weakneſſe. All the comfort that ſhe had was but to encreaſe her ardences with beholding that face which was the cauſe of her miſſeries, which dayly grew pale under the ſmoak of its owne fires.</p>
               <p>Love had made a kind of contrary mixture, in theſe ſouls, and beſtowed ſhafts of a contrary opperation, in their vulneration. <hi>Panthea</hi> ſought all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of acoſting <hi>Argelois,</hi> and he all means to avoid her ſpeeches, which he effected ſo cunningly that ſhe could never have the liberty ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The complaints ſhe made to her brother were very bitter and deplorable but the love of friendſhip was too ſtrong to be ſhaken by that of affection, ſo that ſhe gained little comfort from either, which when ſhe ſaw ſhe was faine to continue the martyr of Love, and ſilently endure thoſe torments, which had almoſt finiſhed the life of that faire and lovely creature, the luſtre of whoſe beauty came little behinde that of the incomparable <hi>Eliana. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelois</hi> not only avoided! with all dilligence, the company of the princeſſe <hi>Panthea,</hi> but even that of <hi>Dardanus</hi> began to be diſgracefull to him, which made him ſeek out new places of retirement in the woods where he often made deplorable ſpeeches amongſt the <hi>Driades,</hi> and thought to quench the fire in his heart by the waters of his eyes, ſome few weeks paſſed over, in which time, the exceſſe of torment, he continually, without any intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion endured, had ſo dejected him that he was hardly to be known. That fair face in which majeſty and lovelineſſe, ſtrove for Maſterſhip, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wholy the ſeat of paleneſſe. Thoſe eyes who vivacitly enkindled ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors in the hearts of beholders, ſeem'd to have left all their fires, and were become dead and without motion. He ſeemed to be but the ſhaddow of what he had been, or as if ſickneſſe had enchained him to his bed many moneths. There is nothing can alter the body like the extream paſſions of the ſoul, and their is no paſſion ſo terrible, as that of love, and almoſt impoſſible it is, not to diſcover it in the face, for by how much the more ſecreetly it burnes, by ſo much the more furiouſly it flames. Theſe fires had ſo long inuſted the heart of this noble <hi>Heroe,</hi> and ſo ſecreetly that now he began to ſink under its power, and to yield his life to diſpair. <hi>Panthea</hi> whoſe love intereſted her in his looks, found there alſo augmentations of her troubles, but all that paleneſſe, could not hide from her eyes that lovelineſſe which was wont to exhibit it ſelf, ſhe at leaſt fancied ſhe ſaw it through the cloudes, the eyes of love being more piercing than any others or elſe ſhe fed her fires with thoſe aſhes that ſhe ſaw ſtrew'd on the face of <hi>Argelois.</hi> She daily ſolicited her brother to his comfort, who accuſed her for being the cauſe of his miſeries. 'Tis nothing but becauſe of your paſſion (ſaid <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi>) he is ſo ſenſible of your trouble (but being too generous, he thinks he cannot ſatisfie you without debaſeing you below that quality, which you were born to) that he does pennance for the injury of his looks; doe you leave to love him, and he will leave theſe ſadneſſes. Ah! cruell fair (cry'd <hi>Panthea</hi>) cannot you be only inſenſibly but envious too? is your diſdain ſo of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51633:96"/> great, that you will force me not to love by ſuch ſevere meanes? Tell him ah! tell him, that he ſhall have the comfort to ſee me die, to rid him of that trouble to which his diſdain praecipitates him. Let him no more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf <hi>Panthea</hi> will tryumph over all her misfortunes, and with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thrill free that heart love hath allready peirced. <hi>Dardanus</hi> much troubled at his ſiſters tranſport, It is his pity (ſaid he) that afflicts him, his heart is not capeable of that evil you accuſe him of. Torment not your ſelf except you deſire to drive him to a further deſpaire. <hi>Panthea</hi> at leaſure thought on theſe words, and when ſhe was by her ſelf; can <hi>I</hi> beleive this! (ſaid ſhe) ah! falſe brother to inject it! alas! can <hi>Argelois</hi> be ſo pitifull and cruell in one inſtant? Can contraries mix in one body? Ah! how happy ſhould I be if this were true! if that inſenſible one ſhould leave to be impaſſible, and ſhould alitle reſent my miſeries and pity my afflictions, though he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to fullfill my deſires. Ah! ſtrange generoſity that can withhold one from enjoying a happineſſe deſired, ah! vaine thought, fooliſh <hi>Panthea</hi> canſt thou believe it? no, no, 'tis too fond and fooliſh a vanity to thinke it.</p>
               <p>Theſe thoughts agitated this faire ſoul ſome time, and made her in a ſilent kind of ſtupor walke a great while about her chamber. At laſt as it were awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a dreame wherein ſome ſtrange thing had betided, ſhe ſtopt with a ſudden ſcriech ah! ſtraing injection cry'd ſhe out, and then ſtop't. Some moments after. Ah! blinde eyes (cry'd ſhe) ah! fooliſh and inſulſe <hi>Panthea,</hi> where hath been thy ſenſes? Where hath been thy witts? how was it poſſible, that thou couldſt be ſo fooliſhly blind all this time? do'ſt thou doubt it? no no call to thy remembrance all his actions paſſ'd, and you will ſee it as clear as the day. Doubt no longer, 'tis <hi>Eliana</hi> that he ſighs for, 'tis ſhe that hath brought him to this paſſe. Thy beauty is not ſo deſpicable but he would have accounted himſelf happy to enjoy what thou profereſt, without thoſe vaine conſiderations, were not his heart allready conjoyned to <hi>Eliana.</hi> Ah! cruel <hi>Eliana</hi> to rob me of a heart that thou haſt no paſſion for, and which thou art not like to enjoy. What ſay I? alas! can ſhe behold that fair one, that wonder of nature? that mirror of men? and not behold him with paſſion, doubt it not, though ſhe hath that power to conceile it. Well, heaven hath ſo ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, thou muſt dye, and <hi>Eliana</hi> muſt enjoy that, thou art not accounted worthy of.</p>
               <p>Theſe thoughts extremly added to her torments, and caſt her into utter deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, for whilſt ſhe thought him free, ſhe had ſome hopes to have mollified his obdurate heart, but theſe thoughts loſt all her hopes. She confirm'd her ſelf in her opinion by denoteing the actions of <hi>Argelois.</hi> Jelouſy open'd her eyes and made her ſee what ſhe had taken no notiſe of before, ſhe obſerv'd his looks, his cariage, and his ſpeeches before <hi>Eliana,</hi> ſhe took notiſe of his ſighes, and by all geſtures, words, and ſignes, ſhe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered ſomthing to confirm her opinion, and admir'd with her ſelf that ſhe had been ſo blind ſo long. The next time ſhe was alone with <hi>Dardanus</hi> as ſhe was walking, ſhe ſuddenly ſtopt, and ſpeaking to him, Brother (ſaid ſhe) you accuſed me for cauſing the trouble of <hi>Argelois,</hi> but I tell you, his life lies in your power, and none beſides your ſelf can recover him. <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> wondering at his ſiſters ſpeeches reply'd. If it lies in my power this ſhall be the laſt moment of his trouble, were it with the parting of my Life. It may be (ſaid <hi>Panthea</hi>) it may be ſomething dearer than your life. Pray (ſaid <hi>Dardanus</hi>) hold me no longer from the knowledg of that thing that may give eaſe to the better part of my life. Brother (reply'd that afflicted one) I have hitherto hid nothing from you, I have communicated to you all the thoughts of my heart, as you may well judge in that I have not hid my inſulſities, nor been aſham'd to confeſſe to you my Love, yet I am affraid to tell you this, left

You hardly can credite what I ſay (went on <hi>Panthea</hi>) truly I would not believe my own thoughts till I had ſatisfied my ſelf by obſerving what I never denoted before, 'tis too true, and by that time you have conſidered his lookes, and mark'd his actions, you will ſay as I do.

Dear <hi>Argelois</hi> I muſt accuſe thee for breaking thoſe linkes of amity by which we are conjoyn'd, and by which of two we are become one: This is contrary to the nature of union for you to ſmother thoſe thoughts in your own breaſt, which by the right of friendſhip I may claime intereſt in. None can be ſo blinde as not to ſee the trouble of your ſoul by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated ſadneſſe in your face, and none can be ſo ignorant as to think that ſadneſſe to proceed from no cauſe. Hide not from me my dear friend that which is able to give you ſuch cruciations, let it be what it will be the Love I bear you will carry me to do thoſe things that you may account impoſſibilities, my life is the leaſt thing that I eſteeme, ſo it may free you from this ſadneſſe. Leave theſe impieties againſt your ſelf (ſaid <hi>Argelois</hi>) I am too much honored by the leaſt notice you are pleaſed to take of me.

Ceaſe dear <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelois</hi> (ſaid <hi>Dardanus</hi>) I have often told thee that 'tis thy virtue that has conjoyned me to thee, and thou art not to diſpute that now, ſince thou haſt granted me that entire and indiſſoluable Love which is compacted between us. Now it is that you begin to rebell, and to break thoſe reciprocall Lawes of friendſhip made between us, by withdrawing the knowledg of thoſe things that cauſes theſe ſad and pityfull looks. Do not think I will be put off for <hi>I</hi> cannot live and ſee you ſo grieved: certainly you know not my affection that you dare not truſt me. I have not the leaſt ſuſpicion of your love and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy (reply'd <hi>Argelois</hi>) it is far beyond what ever I have or can deſerve, though my life were to continue in your ſervice to the end of the world. Had I any thoughts worthy your knowledg they ſhould not be hid from you, but this ſadneſs that hath lately exhibited it ſelf in my face is a kind of a ſtrange humour which hath ſtolen upon me by degrees, and will ſuddenly vaniſh. Every thing muſt have its period, and I am conſcious to my ſelf this is allmoſt at an end. That is it I fear (ſaid <hi>Dardanus</hi> embraceing him very paſſionatly) thy life and it will end together, well <hi>I</hi> muſt and will remedy it and you ſhall ſee that I will think nothing to dear to give content to <hi>Argelois.</hi>

As they were walking together one day <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> obſerving very narrowly thoſe ſhaddowes of former beautie in his face was moved with a great deal of pity towards him. He anſwered to moſt of her diſcourſes ſo broakenly and confuſedly that ſhe ſaw the agitations of his minde not only to alter the forme of his body, but alſo to diſturbe his intellectualls.</p>
               <p>I wonder (ſaid <hi>Eliana</hi>) at this great alteration in you, ſurely it cannot be the effect of a ſmall trouble that can have ſuch dominion over your body and minde, as to alter the one and diſturb the other. <hi>Argelois</hi> ſtartled at theſe words, ſeeing ſhe took notice of his agitations. Madam (ſaid he) ſuch is the effect of Melancholy that it gives to them that diſcourſe with ſuch perſons matter enough to exerciſe their patience to hear their <hi>tautolig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is not (reply'd ſhe) the effects of melancholy as it is naturally a paſſion, without ſome extraordinary cauſe; for it is contrary to your conſtitution, 'tis ſome ſtrong paſſion which you ſmother with ſo much art to your own detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe words raiz'd him quite out of his ſtupidity, and as if he had receiv'd ſome quickning from that angelicall voyce his cheeks indu'd a faint bluſh. It is impoſſible to let you know the palpitations of his heart at that time but, Madam (ſaid he trembling) I know not what it is you call paſſion, but <hi>I</hi> rather think 'tis ſome growing diſeaſe not ordinarily known, for (if <hi>I</hi> dare ſay ſo) I find in the midſt of theſe ſadneſſes a ſtrange kind of pleaſure, which yet is afflictive, and yet deſired. So that I cheriſh, my diſeaſe and wiſh for no remedy, for what appears ſo grievous in the eyes of others. 'Tis very ſtrange (reply'd <hi>Eliana</hi>) that you ſhould Love that which is your torment. 'Tis the part of a reſigned ſoul (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Argelois</hi>) to be content with what the Gods ſhall ſend, if their hand hath afflicted me with this ſtrange ſickneſſe I ought to accept of it as their gift, knowing it proceeds from the powerfull hand of an uncontrouling deity. The Gods ſeeme unjuſt (reply'd <hi>Eliana</hi>) to puniſh ſo ſeverely the virteous, and to let the moſt vicious go untouched. We are not (ſaid <hi>Argelois</hi>) to preſcribe a way to heaven or to tell him who they are that ought to be puniſhed, for we are not able to peirce into the ſins of men, which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable only to the penetrating eyes of Heaven. He that ſeems moſt holy in the eyes of men, may be moſt vicious in thoſe of Heaven. You know not (Madam!) what I have deſerved; Truly my aſpiring mind in that it hath given me audaciry above thoſe of my quallity to ſo glorious a converſe with your ſelf hath deſerved theſe thunders of dejection. Virtue cannot ſore to high (return'd <hi>Eliana</hi>) and it is but a vanity that poſſeſſes rhe great ones of the world to conſider great births more than virtue, for true honour proceads from virtue and is regulated by it, therefore the Gods cannot do ſo great injuſtice as to puniſh you for making others happy by your company, I rather thinke it is the meanneſſe of our deſerts that make the Gods to interrupt the felicities we received by your converſation. Men cannot be more pitifull than the Gods, and <hi>I</hi> pity your dejection with all my heart.</p>
               <p>That is enough (ſaid <hi>Argelois</hi>) to make me happy and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh me in my priſtine condition, for your pity is reſtorative. <hi>Dardanus</hi> coming to them put an end to their diſcourſe, but <hi>Argelois</hi> finding the virtue of her ſpeeches to operat much upon his ſoul, and to relax the continual agitations of his thoughts, he often engaged into the like diſcourſe, but with a great diligence leſt he might diſcover the cauſe of his ſadneſſe and Melancholy.</p>

He often perceiv'd that he ſtole out to ſecret places of the woods, where he believ'd he play'd the uſual part of afflicted people, who not having to whom they may commit their ſecrets, blab them to the ſenſeleſs trees or dumb animals, whereby they find ſome eaſe, but no remedy for their complaints. <hi>Dardanus</hi> watch'd him one day, and following him unſeen to the wood, crope near to the place where he lay, amongſt the thickeſt of the bows which intexed their leavy arms in one another, and ſheltred him from his ſight ſufficiently. It was a long time before a world of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geminated ſuſpirations would give him leave to ſpeak, but at laſt caſting his eyes up to heaven, having laid himſelf upon an oblique bank, he began to disburthen thoſe oppreſſing thoughts by moſt pitifull complaints. O Heaven! (ſaid He with a pitifull tone) will you force me to be my own executioner? Will you not yet give leave to <hi>Atropos</hi> to conclude my deſtiny and free me from miſery? It is an act of your mercy to take away a life ſo unſupportable. I beg not to be eaſ'd of my grief any other wayes than by death, ſince it cannot be but by wronging the beſt of friends. But what ſay I? Do <hi>I</hi> ask for that death as will be ſo prejudicial to <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſince he loves me? No let me live only for his ſake! O Gods ye are juſt! and 'tis ſit that I endure theſe torments for the crimes I commit. Ah! dear <hi>Dardanus!</hi> Can you? ah! can you forgive me the crimes that <hi>I</hi> dayly commit againſt you, in loving that beauty which is ordained by heaven for you, and which is too divine for any other mortal than your ſelf? Yes <hi>Dardanus</hi> that ſhall be the laſt thing I will requeſt when I leave this Love conſumed carcaſe, and I doubt not but thy goodneſs will forgive thy <hi>Argelois</hi> a crime which is forced upon him by the uncontrouling pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of love; who though he hath made me to love <hi>Eliana,</hi> ſhall never cauſe me to injure thee by a thought of obtaining her, were my birth anſwerable to her greatneſs. No <hi>Dardanus,</hi> dear <hi>Dardanus,</hi> I hold that tye of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip too dear to be broken for all the content of the whole world. My life ſhall be ſacrificed to maintain it, and it ſhall be kept inviolable though for it I expire. After ſome time of ſilence breaking forth with another tone. Ah damnable thoughts (cryed he) what evil <hi>Daemon</hi> is this that gives theſe injections that tells me, Love conſiders no friendſhip; that for the conſideration of Love we may lawfully break that tye: That Rivals in love are unſupportable though friends or brothers: That <hi>I</hi> ought to account him my enemy that is ſo to my deſires and content: That I ought to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict my ſelf when I may take the obſtacle out of the way by a noble Combate which will be allowable in a rival. O wicked, cruel and deadly ſuſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations! avoid all evil thoughts, and know that 'tis my ſelf, that is rival to my ſelf. It is <hi>Dardanus,</hi> it is no other that is my rival; were it any beſides him, he could not have lived ſo long to my torment, though I had reaped nothing by his death; Love muſt be ſatisfied, and Rivals muſt ſhare the prize by their deaths.

                  <hi>Dardanus</hi> tearing his ſhirt made a ſhift to bind up <hi>Argelois</hi> wound and leading him by the arme they returned to the caſtle. Aſſoon as they were within the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond court, they met with the two princeſſes who were walking under the ſhadow of a row of jeſſemines. <hi>Panthea</hi> had no ſooner caſt her eyes upon <hi>Argelois,</hi> and ſeeing him ſo extraordinary pale with the loſſe of blood, and all his garments diſtained with the eflux that came from his wound; but that the paleneſſe of her face diſcovered the pangs of her heart. Her paſſion and paine was increaſed by the reſtraint ſhe was faine to impoſe upon her ſelfe before <hi>Eliana,</hi> and ſhe had been no longer able to endure thoſe effects had ſhe not vented that paſſion which ſhe was big of. She had eſpied her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cloathes ſprinkled with the crimſon dye of <hi>Argelois</hi> his blood, from which the <hi>acies</hi> of her love drew a colourable deceit to hide what her paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enforced her to. She ran towards them, ah Ar—(cryed ſhe) love being too nimble for her other thoughts had made her almoſt to diſcover what ſhe endeavoured to hide, but preſently ſmothering that word. Ah! dear brother (ſaid ſhe caſting her ſelf upon his neck, but turning her face towards <hi>Argelois,</hi> and looking upon him with eyes that exhibited her paſſion) how come you thus wounded! come let us leave this place where nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habites but ravenous and cruell beaſts, or ſome lethiſerous and inhumane creatures. What hand was it that could be ſo immane as to wound thee? ah! brother—ah <hi>Argelois</hi> where were you at this perpetration? let's know theſe aſſaſſins that we may revenge our ſelves on them. <hi>Dardanus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving to whom ſhe ſpake, and believing the pleaſure he did her to let her vent her paſſion, let her go on a great while without interrupting her. <hi>Argelois</hi> beheld her with wonderfull compaſſion, being none of thoſe inſenſible ones, that cannot be mov'd neither with blood not teares, he knew too well the inſufferable pangs of love, which made him extreamly ſenſible of that poor princeſſe: paſſion giving a kind of dolefull air to theſe words ſhe utter'd, and her eyes ſhewing the languiſhing of her heart encreaſed his commiſeration. Madam (ſaid <hi>Argelois</hi> at laſt) the Prince is not wounded, the Gods have more regard to his perſon, his clothes are onely ſtain'd with blood that flow'd through a ſmall wound which I have accidentally received. <hi>Eliana</hi> glad of <hi>Panthea's</hi> tranſport made good uſe of it to ſettle in the mean time <hi>I</hi> know not what ſignes of inward emotions which appeared in that beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full face. But the prince and <hi>Argelois</hi> had caſt their eyes upon her before ſhe had throughly recollected her ſelfe, and found that exceſſe of ſnow had obvolved the <hi>Hyacinths</hi> in her cheeks, and that her eyes ſhewed a kind of diſturbance, which they knew not how to apply: She noteing their looks ſoon gave life to thoſe bluſhing flowers which uſe to expand themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſheets of ſnow, and reſetling her ſelfe, <hi>Panthea</hi> (ſaid ſhe) intends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſe all to her ſelf, and give me no intereſt in your wounds. They are not many (ſaid <hi>Dardanus</hi>) 'tis only <hi>Argelois</hi> that infortunately hurt his arme, which will be no hindrance at all to your defence if need were. You think us very ſelfiſh then (replyed <hi>Eliana</hi>) and that we deſire your welfare but for our own ends, you are much miſtaken, our natures are not immane we cannot chuſe but pity our enemies in diſtreſſe, much more our friends. <hi>I</hi> had no ſuch uncharitable thoughts (replyed <hi>Dardanus.)

                  <hi>Argelois</hi> could not but find ſome comfort, amidſt all theſe ſadneſſes by that letter, in that the providence of the Gods had ſo ordered the love of his friend, that his own paſſion ſhould breake that marriage which he would have fruſtrated for his ſake, yet it was a long time before he could frame himſelfe to believe, that he who had withſtood the charms of <hi>Eliana,</hi> ſhould be pierc'd by the ſhafts of any other. <hi>Epedauro</hi> was brought to the two princeſſes who deſired him to tell them what was become of his maſter: he following the order he had receiv'd from <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They ſeeing <hi>Epedauro</hi> was not to make known what they deſired, would preſſe him no further, but contented themſelves with what he had told them. But he aſſoon as he had the oportunity to ſpeak with <hi>Argelois</hi> intimated to him that he had ſomething to deliver to him and the princeſſe <hi>Panthea</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part <hi>Argelois</hi> meeting with the princeſſe told her the commiſſion of <hi>Epedauro,</hi> and deſiring her not to defer the audition, they walked into a pleaſant <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiva,</hi> and ſending for <hi>Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>My Lord the Prince <hi>Dardanus</hi> having rod hard all that day, he parted hence,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51633:102"/> and good part of the next, ſtopped about the hotteſt time of the day under the umbrella's of certain trees, which ſtood hard by a great foreſt, whoſe skirt reacheth to the <hi>Euxinian</hi> ſea. After we had refreſhed our ſelves, the Prince, mov'd by I know not what good <hi>Genius,</hi> commanded me and <hi>Chiron</hi> to follow him, and walking amongſt the thick-growing trees of that wild place he thought he heard the ſound of ſome plaintive voyce. Standing ſtill the better to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf, he was aſſured what he heard, was a humane voyce, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be at ſome diſtance, the wiſpering wind bringing it by intervalls, and inarticulate to his eares. Deſireous to know who it might be that was in that place, which ſeemed to be altogether deſolate, or a habitation fit for none but <hi>Philo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We came ſo neer at laſt that we could diſſinguiſh the words, ſome of them being theſe interfalk'd with ſighs &amp; groans. Yes fair princeſs! I do obay your ſevere command; I believe you were ignorant that the ſame words that baniſhed me your preſence, alſo commanded me die, it being impoſſible for me to be deprived of that ſight, which made me happy and Live. Ah! I muſt never more behold thoſe fair eyes that gave life and vigor to my ſoul, cruell baniſhment! but now thou art allmoſt at an end, and theſe teſtimonies of my martyrdom it may be will exuſcitate a pity in that breaſt which could never entertaine Love. Theſe words were uttered with ſo moving an air that it extracted teares from all our eyes. The voyce ſeemed as if it had not been altogether alienated to our eares, but for the preſent neither of us could tell who it was, being ſomwhat chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that doleful aire, and ſighs that interfalcated almoſt every word. Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we heard another voyce, which with ſobs and tears implor'd the other not to perſiſt in ſo cruel a manner to murther a ſoul ſo far ſurmounting others.</p>
               <p>At leaſt (ſaid he) if you will fall under theſe cruel and deteſtable lawes of love, permit me not to ſurvive! ah tye me not to I execute ſo horrid a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration! but let me have that comfort to ſerve you in the <hi>Stygian</hi> ſhades, as faithfully as I have ſerved you here.

At laſt we crope ſo near to them amongſt the bowes that we diſcovered them with our eyes, but the ſpectacle was ſo horrid and amazing that we had ſchreckt out had it not taken from us that power by the aſtoniſhment it cauſed. Thoſe we ſaw were cloathed in very mean cloathes, agreeing in everything with the Ruſtick, he that ſeemed by the duty and obedience he owed the other to be his ſervant, kneeled before him with his back towards us, ſo that we could not diſcover his face, mingling his teares with the others blood, which hath made a little torrent by its effuſion. The bowes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironing his head ſo obſcured his face that we could not ſatisfie our ſelves, or know who he was by that ſight. He ſat upon the ſide of a fountaine which ſeemed to be the habitation of ſome <hi>Naide,</hi> or only f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Before him ſtood a ſtone which ſerved him for a table on which was ſpread a very ſmoth rine of a rtee, on which he was writing with a ſtick ſharpned for that purpoſe, but that which was ſo amazeing was a large wound in his ſide from whence ſlowed a purple ſpring, and into the which he dipt his reed, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crimſon characters with his lateſt blood. The graſſe was diſtained with its colour, and the abundance that ran from his wound had made a riverſe larg enough for love to ſwim in. By his action he ſeemed as if he deſired to inſpire his pen with the laſt breath of that fair ſoul, or to make
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51633:103"/> thoſe bloody characters ſpeak more pathetically, mixed ſpirit and life with his blood. Whilſt he was in his action and our amazedneſſe permiting it longer than we ought he that kneeled before him ſeeing his paleneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak his approaching death, could not but break the ſilence his maſter had impoſed. Ah! cruel <hi>Panthea!</hi> (ſaid he) inſenſible princeſſe. Behold a Prince ſacrificed to your obdurateneſſe. Ah! wretch! ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe words bringing the Prince <hi>Dardanus,</hi> out of one aſtoniſhment into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, made him no longer doubt of that Prince but that it muſt needs be <hi>Arizobanes.</hi> Pity brought him preſently from his amazedneſſe, when he ſaw he had forſaken his pen with theſe words. <hi>Lamedon</hi> (ſpeaking to his ſquire) I can write no more, my ſight is gone, but be thou my faithfull depoſitory, and deliver this, poynting to what he had written) into the hands of the fair <hi>Pan—,</hi> he ſanke at theſe words. The Prince <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> running to him caught him in his armes, and by the words he ſpake and teares he ſhed exhibited his ſad reſentments of his death. See here (ſaid <hi>Epidauro</hi> pulling forth the rine wrapt up) what love dictated at that time, it may be theſe ſanguinious characters may ſpeak more moving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by inſuſing ſome part of that ſpirit that wrote them, than <hi>I</hi> have done. <hi>Argelois</hi> took them of <hi>Epidauro</hi> and turning to <hi>Panthea,</hi> asked her if ſhe would be pleaſed to hear them. That princeſſe who was all Goodneſſe and pity when ſhe ſaw her intereſt in <hi>Epedauro's</hi> diſcourſe was immovable. She could object nothing either againſt the nature, perſon, or behaviour of <hi>Arizobanes,</hi> he had quailities winning enough, and a Prince worthy of that title, by this action you have heard, you may judge of his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and to what exigent Love had drove him. 'Twas nothing but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Love ſhe bore <hi>Argelois</hi> that made her diſregard that Prince, and drive him to that deſpair. Remorſe ſeized on her, and ſhe repented of her laſt action, that drove him to that precipitancy. Pity and compaſſion ſometimes is the procurer of Love, and uſhers it under their diſguize. <hi>Panthea</hi> felt ſomething more moving than ordinary, and ſhe had believed at other times that ſhe could have heard of his death and have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible: But now ſhe found the contary and all the courage ſhe had could not ſuppreſſe thoſe ſad thoughts that oppreſſed her. She looked upon her ſelf as the murtherer of that Prince and imagined that his wound ſpake very dolefully, and upbraided her for her obdurateneſſe. Whether love or Pity, 'tis hard to be decided, or both cauſed her teares, but unwilling to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them to <hi>Epedauro</hi> ſhe turned her head toward <hi>Argelois</hi> and gave way to thoſe drops which could not but be expected from ſo tender and ſuſcept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a ſoul. At laſt fixing her eyes upon <hi>Argelois</hi> ſhe ſeemed to accuſe him, and to make him the cauſe of the diſaſter. She ſuppreſſed her reſentments what ſhe could, but yet there ſecreetly eſcap'd ſome of thoſe aſſured meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of an afflicted ſoul. After ſhe had continued in a ſad and ſilent poſture for ſome time, turning to <hi>Epedauro,</hi> and is the prince dead then? (ſaid ſhe) could he not be recovered? yes maddam (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is the cheifeſt cauſe of the Prince <hi>Dardanus's</hi> ſtay, to perſwade the newly recovered <hi>Arizobanes</hi> from perpetrating the like. For fearing leaſt he ſhould be compelled to break your ſevere command, he is dayly ready
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51633:103"/> to offer a ſecond ſacrifice of himſelf. There is no conſideration can work with him, for he thinks it his duty to die, ſince you have baniſhed him your fight. <hi>Panthea</hi> was very joyfull that he was recovered, though ſhe found a great abatement of that pity which but now ſtimulated her, the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Argelois</hi> being too powerfull for its continuance. But (ſaid ſhe to <hi>Epedauro</hi> to put him beſides that diſcourſe he was in) how did you recover him? and how got you this writing you have brought.</p>
               <p>Madam (went he on) my Lord the Prince having for a long time deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the caſe of <hi>Arizobanes,</hi> at laſt asked <hi>Chiron</hi> whether it were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to recover him, and whether he could not ſhew he deſerved the name he bore, by making known the utmoſt of his care and skill. <hi>Chiron</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſearching the wound with a probe, found it large, but not very deep, and that the inteſtines being intacted, he ſaid he could with facility enough heal up the wound, had he but blood and life in his body. Life had iſſued out with his blood, for that having had ſo large a paſſage, had ſcarce left one drop in his body. <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Having call'd rhe reſt of the ſervants, and being conducted by <hi>Arizobane</hi>'s Squire, we carried the Prince in our arms to a ſmall cottage, about three hundred paces from the wood, in which was none but two decrepit people, who ſeeing the Prince dead fill'd their little Domicil with ejaculations; we laid him in a bed, and obſcuring the room, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Prince <hi>Chiron,</hi> and my ſelf being leſt alone with <hi>Arizobanes,</hi> and his Squire, <hi>Chiron</hi> nearly ſtitching up the wound, applyed thoſe things which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved moſt condu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Preſently we poured down his throat eſſences, and other things that the incomparable <hi>Chiron</hi> had prepared, and with hot cloaths and frications, the Prince himſelf contributing his charitable hand to thoſe labors, ſought to give new fire to that inanimate body.</p>
               <p>We had laboured ſo long, and found ſo little ſign of life; that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved we had attempted a vanity, and were about to give over, a work carried on by the extream deſire of the Prince, when <hi>Chiron</hi> aſſured us the operation of his eſſences, had played the part of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> and had injected fire from their hidden vertue. Before it was night we could all diſcern that there was life, and that it was not impoſſible for us to revive him. The Prince would not leave him all night, but indefagitably conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing his charities ſhewed with what ardency he deſired his life. It was two dayes before he opened his eyes, but then being inſenſible of thoſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they received, he ſhut them again. The third day he ſpoke, which extremly rejoyced the Prince; theſe were the firſt words of that revived man;</p>
               <p>Dear <hi>Panthea!</hi> have I ſatisfied your ſeverity? or is there yet any thing more to be done? <hi>Chiron</hi> hath conducted me to the walk of Lovers, and I find many as gloriouſly tragidized as my ſelf amongſt theſe <hi>Stygean</hi> ſhades.

We perceived by theſe ſpeeches that he thought he had been dead, but <hi>Chiron</hi> told <hi>Dardanus</hi> that it would be very prejudicial and dangerous for him to talke, which made the Prince endeavour to make him ſenſible where he was, but he could not effect it. Weakneſs made him leave ſpeaking, but in lieu of that, he emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted abundance of ſuſpirations. The wound of his ſide began to heal, and all things agreeing with the deſires of the Prince, he began to take that reſt which his love and charity had denyed him. We were accompanied with what the meaneſs of that Cottage could afford, which although it were but evilly, yet it greatly contented the Prince in that he never had taſted the like morſels, nor lay ſo hard, but when he was a ſouldier. The Prince remembring that he had not heard how <hi>Arizobanes</hi> was brought to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igent, ſent for <hi>Lamedon,</hi> and telling him his deſire, he relatee it in theſe words.</p>

               <p>Madam (replyed <hi>Epidauro</hi>) I hope you will pardon me, ſeeing <hi>I</hi> do but render the words of another, and being I ſhould be both unfaithfull and a Detractor, ſhould I leave out ſuch glorious expreſſions of <hi>Lamedons.</hi> 'Tis but reaſon (ſaid <hi>Argelois</hi>) that he ſhould give us the relation entire. I I will not contradict you (ſaid <hi>Panthea</hi> turning to <hi>Argelois</hi>) though I little deſerve them. Their ſilence inviting <hi>Epidauro</hi> to proceed, he continued his relation thus.

He went by the motion of his thoughts, and all our ſpeed ſeem'd like that of a ſnail to thoſe deſires that haſtned his return. We were not long in getting to <hi>Sinope,</hi> where the Prince was wellcomed home by the joy of his Parents and his ſiſter: there he found that ſtout Prince who rendred him a great deal of civility, and was reanſwered by <hi>Arizo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi> with the like. The good King <hi>Pharmach,</hi> knowing the wiſdome and great diſcretion of the Prince his ſon, was reſolved to be ruled by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in this match. The Princeſs whom I dare compate to none but your ſiſter, having her ſpirit as full of meekneſs as her face of beauty, found a great antipathy in her againſt <hi>Pampatius,</hi> and could by no means away with his rough nature, being every way more fit for a ſouldier under <hi>Mars</hi> than <hi>Venus,</hi> and his looks accompanied with ſo much fierceneſs, that they were rather a terriculum than an allurement to Ladies.

The court was in great fear for his recovery, and the generall love he had acquired of all men, made all intereſted in his welfare. But coming to himſelf he aſſured them he was not in ſuch danger they thought him in. Ah! brother (ſaid <hi>Philadelphia</hi>) it had been better that I had been prey to that truculent <hi>Parthian,</hi> and that I had endured the worſt of miſeries rather then you ſhould have engag'd the whole Kingdome into danger with your ſelfe, and our parents into ſorrow for your hurt. He ſatisfied that faire one with many fraternal words, and told her the combate was as well for his own honour as her ſafety. The Chirurgions giving them hopes of his ſudden recovery returned part of their former joy into their faces. The wounds I had receiv'd by my adverſary were not conſiderable enough to make me keep my bed, ſo that <hi>I</hi> had enough to do to be the <hi>praeco</hi> of the combat, which was enternain'd by all with joy for the valour of the Prince.</p>
               <p>His love and deſire to ſee the Princeſſe your ſiſter, contributed much to his cure, and made him willingly undergo what they told him would feſtinate it?

I did not dare to diſſemble with him, ſo that I told him the truth which was this. That ſhe bid me tell him ſhe was forced to infringe the laws of civility ſince he was filled with ſo much importunancy, and that ſhe could no longer breake her repoſe for his pleaſure, and therefore ſhe deſired him to leave her and diſturb her no more with his preſence. Theſe words wrought the like effect as the former, and it was a long time before I could recall his ſenſes from a baniſhment which had like to have been eternall. Uſhering his words with heart-breaking ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's, Yes <hi>Panthea I</hi> will obey and give you that repoſe you deſire, it may be my death may be gratefull to your eares, when you are aſſured you ſhall be free from your tormentor. I confeſſe I have been too impudent and too bold, but I will endeavour to exterminate a monſter ſo horrible to your ſight. He was not to be comforted and therefore I permited him to eaſe his paſſion with ſuch ejaculations without interrupting him. That night he cloſ'd not his eyes but imagin'd all the precipitances as could be, hardly tormenting enough to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate his crimes.The next morning pretending buſineſſe into <hi>Itali</hi> he left <hi>Thrace</hi> and landing in <hi>Aſia,</hi> after he had traverſed all the woods and ſolitary places he found out this cottage free from neighbours and very ſolitary. Reſolving to end his life in theſe woods he would have ſent me away, unleſſe <hi>I</hi> would ſwear by thoſe oaths which we account damnable to break, not to contradict him but to let him follow thoſe dictates which his love and diſpair gave him. I was forc'd to to do this ſtrict obedience rather then I would leave him I hoped that my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions might prevaile againſt all precipitances, and that at leaſt if he dyed I might have the honour to accompany him. We came to this cottage and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our horſes of their burdens gave them the liberty of theſe ſpatious woods, we exchang'd our clothes for theſe you found us in, by the help of theſe two an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent people, and enriching them with all the gold &amp; jewels the Prince had about him, purchaſ'd our living &amp; their love.

He ſent me away to ſeek him ſuch another, but before I returned he had made the wound in his ſide, and was characteriſing with his blood. <hi>I</hi> ran to him, and ſcreching out would have ſtopt it, but he taking up the dagger, put me in mind of my oath, and commanded me not to diſturb him, but to let him finiſh what he had begun to write.

In a weeks time <hi>Chiron</hi> had brought <hi>Arizobanes</hi> to his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and <hi>Dardanus</hi> preſented himſelf to him, and told him by what means he had been ſaved. Ah! Gods (ſaid <hi>Arizobanes</hi>) I cannot conteſt with your Divinities, yet pardon me if I cannot give thanks for the ſaving of my life. But is it <hi>Dardanus</hi> that is my Conſervator? how little reaſon hath he to preſerve that which is unſupportable to his ſiſter? The Prince comforting him with words naturally ſweet and moving, perſwaded him not to afflict himſelf ſo much, and promiſed him to uſe the utmoſt of his power to make him happy. <hi>Arizobanes</hi> preſently called for what he had written, the Prince believing his intentions, got ſome more of that kind of paper, and giving the right to the Squite, bid him give it to his Maſter. After he had looked it over, and ſigh'd, he commanded him to burn it in his preſence. <hi>Dardanus</hi> unwilling that you ſhould looſe the ſight of that ſtrong teſtimony of his paſſion, conveighed the blanks into the fire, and preſerved theſe unſeen. <hi>Arizobanes</hi> every day recovering of his wound, began at laſt to leave his bed.

No no <hi>Argelois!</hi> thoſe pale cheeks diſcover the ſecreet flames of thy heart. Thou art not exempt from his tyranny that wounded me. Yes you cannot deny it, and 'tis <hi>Eliana</hi> too. <hi>Argelois</hi> was extremely troubled at theſe words, but <hi>Dardanus</hi> having before made him acquainted with her ſuſpicion, he was the better able to anſwer her. Madam (ſaid he) I hope you will have more chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51633:107"/> thoughts than to thinke <hi>I</hi> ſhould offer ſo much diſhonour to a princeſſe, as to ſet my affection ſo aſpiringly. You judge of me by the greatneſſe which I am ariv'd at by your immens favours, and not by that which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>I</hi> am. You may (ſaid the princeſſe) deny it if you pleaſe, but theſe are no arguments to contradict what I ſay, for it is no voluntary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to love, and I cannot account that an injury which one is impelled to. Yes <hi>Argelois</hi> I know her charmes to be more attracting than mine, and <hi>I</hi> will yeild her the victory, but it ſhall be with my life. <hi>Argelois</hi> would have anſwered her but that <hi>Eliana</hi> and <hi>Tribulus</hi> walking by the place cauſed them to joyne company with them, where they paſſed good part of the day in thoſe umbracula's, in ſeverall diſcourſes, whilſt their hearts entertained divers Cogitations.</p>
               <p>The next day <hi>Argelois</hi> having not viſited <hi>Euripides</hi> a good while, was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards his grot, when meeting with <hi>Epidauro</hi> they diſcourſed together of ſeverall particulars till they came to the Grove. <hi>Argelois</hi> believing he ſhould do <hi>Euripides</hi> a pleaſure to let him hear ſome actions of <hi>Dardanus,</hi> took his favourite with him. <hi>Euripides</hi> embracing him gave him his wonted reception, which was all kindneſſe, being as it were ty'd to him by thoſe charmes that allwayes accompained his preſence. <hi>Euripides</hi> underſtanding for what end he had brought <hi>Epidauro</hi> gave him many thanks, and preſently prepared for the audition. <hi>Epidauro</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Argelois</hi> what they deſired of him, was nothign difficult to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that taske, at the requeſt of his maſters greateſt friend. <hi>Argelois</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to repoſe himſelf, or rather to give way to his wonted amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous meditations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſlung himſelf upon a bed. <hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Lonoxia</hi> takeing <hi>Epidauro</hi> by the hand, led him into another room, where haveing placed him between them, they invited him by their ſilence to what he knew they expected.

                  <head>THE HISTORIE of DARDANUS.</head>
                  <p>MY years not exceeding thoſe of the Prince, declare that what I ſpeak from his infancy, were the dictates of thoſe who were both this maſters and his ſervants. <hi>Palemon</hi> after that notable overthrow of <hi>Mark Antonie</hi> living in great fear of the <hi>Romans</hi> for the affection he had ſhewn that Prince, retired amongſt the <hi>Getes</hi> and pitching in <hi>Tomos</hi> lived amongſt a people civilized by the ſwan-like notes of the <hi>Sulmonian</hi> bard. Marying with <hi>Agauue</hi> the nece of <hi>Tarcondemus</hi> King of <hi>Celiſia,</hi> they produced <hi>Dardanus</hi> the fruit of that conjunction into the world. About that time by a ſtrange misfortune, <hi>Palemedon,</hi> ſon to <hi>Palemon</hi> by his other wife was loſt, being raviſhed out of the arms of his nurſe by ſome wicked Aſſaſſius. <hi>[Euripides</hi> could not but but ſhew his intereſt in that ſpeech by a ſigh that he emitted, but it not being noted <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauro</hi> continued thus] But ſure the Gods fore-ſeeing the virtues of the prince my maſter, ſhewed by this action that he deſerved to be ſomething more than ſecond to the Crown. There was great lamentation for the loſs of that young Prince, and the King had not been to be comforted but by the ſight of <hi>Dardanus,</hi> who now received the whole influence of the Kings love, which elſe muſt have been ſhared between them.</p>
                  <p>After that the <hi>Romans</hi> had reduced <hi>Capadocia, Comagena</hi> and other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms into provinces, and that the King ſaw they did not diſturb him, they removed to <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> where he made his peace with the <hi>Romans:</hi> And for ſome tribute which he was forced to pay them, they aſſigned him <hi>Byzantium</hi> for his court, and gave him good part of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and in <hi>Aſia</hi> all that along the <hi>Pontic</hi> ſea. In the mean time the young Prince <hi>Dardanus,</hi> have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tutors that were moſt excellent, grew ſo expert in all the ſciences, that he ſhewed that the barbarity of the place where he was born, had contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing to his nature, and made all expect the incomparable fruit of ſo fair bloſſomes. He not only excelled in litte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51633:108"/> make him excell all men. He was but young in years when the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that his tutors was not ſufficient for his large cappacity, ſent him to <hi>Athens,</hi> where in that nurſe of the muſes, his pregnant wit ran through and peirc'd into the profundity of Philoſophy. <hi>I</hi> had then the honour to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him and to be his ſervant. In that place it was that he fell acquainted with the amiable, and no leſſe generous <hi>Argelois.</hi> The parity of their yeares, their conſimilitude of their featurs, the profundety of their wits, and the correſpondency of thier affections, compoſed an amity indiſſolvable but by the power of Eternall Night. They were ſeldome a part, and for all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>Argelois</hi> knowing <hi>Dardanus</hi> to be a Prince yet he would give him no other appellation than Brother, and commanded him to do the like. They were the mirror of <hi>Athens</hi> both for frindſhip and all things elſe, at prizes they ſtrove to make each other conquerer, and to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This continued untill <hi>Argelois</hi> was ſent for home by his too indulgent father, this meſage raized a war betwixt love and obedience in <hi>Argelois,</hi> but the laſt lecture he had read being ſo full of paraenetick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions concerning obedience to parents, he was forced to leave his friend <hi>Dardanus,</hi> by the ſtrong impreſſions thereof. This ſeparation was not without teares, and reciprocall ingagement on either ſide, to overcome time and abſence, by their conſtant and intire affection. They vow'd that friendſhip which was to laſt eternally, and which was not to be defaced by any accidents of Forune or Time. He had not long leſt the <hi>Tritonian</hi> towers but that my maſter found the miſs of that incomperable man; in his eyes, the Muſes had accompained his friend, and left their ancient ſeat. The graces were no where to be ſound, and the City ſeemed diſſolate and melancholy ſince the abſence of <hi>Argelois. Epidauro</hi> (ſaid he to me) <hi>I</hi> can no more find that delight a ſuavity in theſe dull lucubrations ſince the abſence of <hi>Argelois,</hi> as formerly. Theſe ſchooles are too melancholy and ſedentary. I do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be a docter or <hi>ſophus,</hi> I am well enough skilled in this ſpeculative knowledge, armes ought to be my profeſſion, and though literature and the ſword have an equall ſhare in the regiment of a Kingdom, yet there is no pollicy like to that of experience. Nothing like to example; precepts are nothing ſo vively repreſented, nor ſo ſoone caught, nor ſo long retained. A great pollitition in the ſchool moſt times proves a meer fool in the Court. As if that variety of changes, and actions of men were to be tyed to the rules of the ſchool. No <hi>Epidauro,</hi> I ſhall learn more experience, and gain more knowledg in being on yeer at <hi>Rome,</hi> than I ſhall in ſpending ten here. But if it were for no other reaſon but to divertize me from the trouble I receive by the abſence of <hi>Argelois,</hi> I am reſolved to put it in execution I will to <hi>Rome</hi> and vew that City that impoſes Lawes to the whole world. I had allwayes a great fancy to travell, ſo that he jumped with my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, yet knowing him to be a Prince on whoſe life the happineſſe of a kingdom depended, and my maſter, I did my duty in perſwading him to the contrary, and in declaring the dangers, perils &amp; accidents that always attended travell. I repreſented to him his minority, his parents trouble, the Kingdomes ſadneſſe, with every thing that duty, and the exiguty of my intellectualls were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to dictate. But he that was non of thoſe that could be turn'd every way by the wind of perſwaſion, ſtuck to his firſt reſolutions, and commanding me as a maſter, I obayed him as a ſervant. After I had according to his command prepared every thing ready for his voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> we left <hi>Attica</hi> and with a very proſperous wind a rived at that Citty which extended her authority from the orient to the <hi>Heſperian</hi> wave. That Citty had not recovered thoſe ſadneſſes and habits of mourning ſhe had aſſumed for the death of <hi>Druſus,</hi> when

But yet it had ſo much beauty in it, as to inchant the minde of <hi>Dardanus,</hi> and to make him reſolve for to ſtay ſome few years. The Prince hiding his condition took a lodging amongſt the Knights of <hi>Rome:</hi> And though it were not altogether correſpondent to the Quallity of a Prince, yet it might anſwer to that of a noble man. He ſoon grew acqainted, and with that winning carriage, and attracting ſpeech proper to himſelf, he bound many ſlaves to his courtiſie, and civillity, and overcoming envy it ſelf, made thoſe who were enimies to virtue, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg him ſcarſcly to be parrallel'd. Three whole years remained we in that City, in which time 'tis incredible to declare the pollicies, the experiences, and the obſervations he had gained. His greateſt divertizment was in the <hi>Martian</hi> field in which he gained the praiſe and acclamations of the whole City. Amongſt the reſt of his numerous acquaintance was that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of men the wicked <hi>Caligula</hi> ſon to the good <hi>Germanicus,</hi> and whom now for a fatall plague to themſelves <hi>Rome</hi> hath choſen Emperor. My maſter ſoon ſaw the evil of his condition, and though he keept them from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique noteing, it may be hoping for the Empire, yet thoſe that uſed his company ſaw his vices perſpicuous enough, and his frequent, and intoller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able debauches odious. I verily believe now he hath attaind that dignity in which he may commit them without fear of taxing, he will not ſtick to exhibit in publique what before he Committed in private. The good nature of my maſter was not able to work upon that monſter, who like the ſpider extracted poyſon out of the faireſt flowers. He would have been leſſe ingaged to him, but that the innumerable favours which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from him cauſed him to anſwer his civillities, with his company and to indure thoſe inſulſities which he ſaw him dayly commit. That monſter <hi>Caligula</hi> ſeemed every day more affectionate than other to my maſter and as if he had been courting his miſtreſſe he would with new coyn'd words ſeek to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the affection he bore him. My maſter being but a child in impieties could not imagin that turpitude that was lodg'd in the putrified breaſt of <hi>Caligula.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After a while he brought him acquainted with <hi>Sejanus</hi> that great favourit of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and his great inſtructor to all cruelties and impieties. This was he that was to uſher in the beaſtly and abominable deſires of <hi>Caligula,</hi> who had made him his counceller, and deputy to effect his wickdneſſe. <hi>Dardanus</hi> after that <hi>Seajnus</hi> had one day with the beſt of his <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and with many words exhibited the extream love and affection <hi>Caligula</hi> bore him, and that it reſted in him to make <hi>Caligula</hi> happy by a continuall and more near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, promiſed very innocently that there was nothing that <hi>Caligula</hi> could deſire from him, but he ſhould be both ready and willing to pleaſure him, and that he ſhould count it no ſmall happineſſe to enjoy his company often. My maſter here ſerved <hi>Sejanus</hi> with ſome of his own Cities compliments, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what his heart denyed, for I am ſure of all men living he cared leaſt for thoſe two <hi>Sejanus</hi> and <hi>Caligula.</hi> But <hi>Sejanus</hi> had enough, and <hi>I</hi> believe judged my maſters words by his own beaſtly thoughts.

What do you think <hi>Sejanus</hi> came for? it was but to tell me with the beſt of his language the great love and affection of <hi>Caligula.</hi> For my part I would ſoon ride my ſelf of their convers, but that, it may be, the Gods hath deſign'd me for their inſtruments to reclame them from their vices, and for that end haith ſtirred up this affection in <hi>Caligula;</hi> which I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to proceed from his own wicked nature.

At laſt, But do'ſt thinke it <hi>Epidauro?</hi> (ſaid he extreamly irritated) Oh heavens can man be guilty of ſuch crimes!

I had but juſt lay'd the Princes paſſion when <hi>Caligula</hi> came in: my Maſter gave him a reception without exhibiting any diſturbance, or ſhew of anger.

My maſter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd him, with many ordinary diſcourſes, which he ſeemed to endure with wounderfull impatience, and often turning his eyes like comets on <hi>Dardanus</hi> thought to make him underſtand his deſire, by that ocular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.

It was a long time before the ſtrength and ſury of his Luſt could overcome that awe which the gravity and Majeſty of young <hi>Dardanus</hi> had ſtruck him with, 'twas that ſuſpended his embraces, till night began to vaile that Majeſty, and ſeem'd to lend its dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſhoddow a crime unworthy the leaſt of any light. The darkneſſe begining to hide thoſe fair eyes of the Prince, which ſtroak an awe, into the ſoul of <hi>Caligula,</hi> and which with their lightning carried ſuch a virtue that o're power'd the vicious thoughts and inſtigations of that wretch, he began to caſt his laſcivious armes about his neck, and preſſing his cheeks with his lips. Ah dear <hi>Dardanus</hi> (ſaid he) how ſurpaſſing is thy beauty all the <hi>Romane</hi> dames!Thou haſt rob'd them of all their glory, and the beauty of the faireſt could never gain that power over my ſoul as thine has done, with that he preſſed the Prince backward upon the bed, and began to uſe uncivill actions, which were the preparitories to his crimes. <hi>Dardanus</hi> throughly heated with a generous diſdaine, forc'd himſelf up, and thruſting <hi>Caligu'a</hi> backward overturned him in the flore.

This moment ought to give termination to that impious life of thine, but I ſpare it for the ſake of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> who never did act worthy repentance or crimination but in giving life to thee. <hi>Caligula</hi> was ſo amaz'd at this repulſe, that 'twas a long time er'e he could recollect

The Prince calling me commanded that <hi>Caligula</hi> might be lighted forth with a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, and turning from him went into another room: he ſtood a great while with his eyes dejected, at laſt ſeeing the Prince not there, he followed me muttering <hi>I</hi> know not what revenge. Tell your maſter (ſaid he to me at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) that he will repent what he hath done; he ſhould have conſidered my quallity and power when he affronted me. <hi>Dardanus</hi> little regarded his threats when I told him, but ſmiling, I did not (ſaid he) believe ſuch vicious deſires could have been harbourd in the breaſt of man, as I now ſee by this <hi>paedo.</hi> This City (reply'd I) as it hath in it the moſt eminent virtues, ſo likewiſe hath it the greateſt vices, they are both intermixed, and neither are wanting in this populous place. The next day <hi>Dardanus</hi> met <hi>Sejan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in the ſtreet, and not being able to moderate his anger, told him very roughly, that the day before he had relinquiſh'd his office of captain to play the <hi>Pandar</hi> or worſe and for reparation he deſired to accompany him into the feild where the ſhould ſee he was neither woman nor child. <hi>Sejanus</hi> being of a temper extreamly cholorick, gave command to ſome of his ſouldiers that followed him (he being captain of the <hi>Pretorian Cohorts</hi>) to cut my maſter in peices. They who were not to diſpute the legality of his command, ſhewed they were true ſouldiers by their blind obedience, about ten of them evaginated their ſwords, whoſe glittering had been enough to have ſent a mean ſpirited man to the lower ſhads. The Prince as young as he was, nothing terrified at their number, or power, drew his weapon, and with the firſt thruſt had almoſt ſunk <hi>Sejanus</hi> with giving him a ſight of the effuſion of his own blood. Go baſe ſtuprator (ſaid he) the life of <hi>Druſus</hi> and the whordome thou haſt committed with his wife, ſhould in juſtice have long ſince finiſhed thy dayes. The ſouldiers in the mean time had let fall their weapons on <hi>Dardanus</hi> and had made way for the effuſion of that blood which was too royal to be ſo baſely ſpilt. I gave him my weak aſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance &amp; the love I bore him made me more valiant than ordinary. But the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that the Prince did are incredible; he fought not like a man deſpaireing of his life, or deſirous to dye in a kind of furious precipitancy, but like one of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wiſdom, ſo guarding himſelf, and ſo offending them that he laid eight of them at his feet, to accompany the other two which fortunatly I had ſlaine. Theſe were <hi>Romans</hi> and of the ſtouteſt of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and therefore you will look upon it more then the routing of an hundred <hi>Aſians.</hi> But this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream valour could not have long deterred my maſters death, for twenty more of thoſe ſouldiers drawing their ſwords had devided us into as many peices if at that inſtant <hi>Caligula</hi> had not come to our aſſiſtance, who ſeeing ſo great hurly burly in the middeſt of the City, preſſed through the croud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſired by all the people to ſave the life of a youth whom <hi>Sejanus</hi> ſought to murther. He arrived juſt at the inſtant of this freſh aſſault, and beholding <hi>Dardanus</hi> in that danger, went below his greatneſſe to implore <hi>Sejanus</hi> for our lives. <hi>Sejanus</hi> believing one day he might prove as good a maſter as <hi>Tiberius,</hi> did not dare to diſpleaſe him, and though his anger were impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable yet he ſeemed to comply, and commanded his ſouldiers to reſtrain their hands. My maſter was more vext that he was ſuccored by <hi>Caligula</hi> than at the death he ſhould have received.

                     </gap>e hurt than all the wounds he ſhould receive in all his life. About the middle of the night the ſmart of my wounds keeping me awake, <hi>I</hi> heard a murmer of voyces, and whiſpering in the ſtreet, with the noiſe ſome made in forceing the gates of the houſe. I got preſently to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and putting my head through the grates <hi>I</hi> eſpied <hi>Sejanus</hi> by the light of the torches, and about thirty ſouldiers with him, endeavouring to force the gates with iron barrs. Affrighted at the mans wickedneſſe I ran to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's bed-ſide and ſuddenly awaking him, told him that he had but few moments to live if he did not ſave his life immediately, after I had told him what I had ſeen. Come (ſaid he) let's die willingly, however I will not be ſlain in my bed; it may be this wounded arme may yet give that impious <hi>Sejanus</hi> a juſt reward, and <hi>I</hi> may have the content to ſee him expire with me. He preſently left his bed, and made himſelf ready with more agility than <hi>I</hi> could have imagined. Taking his ſword come <hi>Epidauro</hi> (ſaid he) let us not await their comming to us, let us meet them half way, and ſhow that our courage is not exhauſted with our blood. I ſeeing his reſolution flung my ſelf at his feet, and told him with teares that he ought not ſo raſhly to precipitate himſelf, but to ſave that life which was not to be at his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſince ſo many had intereſt in it, and whilſt there was a way open for our ſafety. What ſaid he muſt I fly then? have I been thus long in learning to fight? and muſt I learn now to fly? I reply'd that to precipitate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into ſuch an unequall fight was not a ſign of valour but of diſpair, which was the badge of a coward, and could never enter into an <hi>heroic</hi> breaſt. And though he had learned to fight yet he never learned to cope with ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and that it was no ſige of cowardize, or would be any ſtain to his honour to ſave his life by a retreat from an inevitable death, when no extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity preſſed him to it. And that in his ſlight he would ſhew his wiſdome, but in his ſtay folly and madneſſe, well then (ſaid he at laſt) I'le ſave thy life ſince thou art ſo unwilling to loſe it.</p>
                  <p>By that time he had ſaid thus they were got to the chamber dore which I had faſtned with two great iron bolts, which ſecured us whilſt we gained a back dore at the end of a gallery into which our chamber dore opened. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtning that dore after us we deſcended a part of winding ſtares which brought us into the garden, out of which we got into the ſtreet, and ſo eſcaped to a friends houſe of my maſters. He told us that there would be no ſafety for us in the City ſo long as <hi>Sejanus</hi> was our enemy. My maſter being willing to leave <hi>Caligula</hi> procured horſes of his friend and departed before it was light. He was out of the City before he had reſolv'd whither to go, at laſt being througly irritated at this unworthy doings of <hi>Sejanus,</hi> he told me he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go to the Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> and complain of his debauches. I ſought with all the arguments I had to cauſe him break that reſolution, knowing that the Emperour had put to death ſome of the chiefeſt men in <hi>Rome</hi> for ſpeaking againſt his favourites, ſo that the danger he incurred was no leſſe then that we eſcaped. But not being able to alter his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we road directly to <hi>Neapolis</hi> where the Emperour was. When we were there we underſtood he was in the Iſle <hi>Capra.</hi> Our journey, although I had been carefull to dreſſe my maſters wounds, had ſo diſturb'd them that they bled afreſh, and put him into great danger, nevertheleſſe he would be conducted

                     </hi> which was not far, being come thither and admitted into the preſence of the Emperour, he put one knee to the ground, and bowing with a very handſome grace. Sir (ſaid he with a tone that raviſhed the eares of his auditors) I come now from <hi>Rome</hi> bloody as you ſee, and full of wounds, having received them from the hands of <hi>Sejanus</hi> though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly and moſt cruelly, he making thoſe <hi>Pretorian</hi> bands which are for the ſafeguard of the City, to become the diſtruction of the common-wealth. I doubt not but your Majeſty knows what belongs to the rules of regiment, and I know you are too good a Prince to ſuffer your ſubjects to groan under the tyranny of a man who is grown inſupportable, and whoſe frequent debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and cruelties have almoſt ſubverted the order and rules of that City, which heretofore hath been the harbour for the diſtreſſed, but now is become as the moſt dangerous rock in the Ocean: ſtrangers ſhun the place, the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens are weary of it, and all cry out of the inſolences of that man, who, whilſt you are here for your repoſe, playes the <hi>Emperour,</hi> doth what he liſt, commands all, and abuſes the authority you have put into his hands. The reaſon Sir, why you have not heard of this before now, was for fear of the danger they might incurre by your ſeverity who ſhould adventure to ſpeake againſt one ſo highly favoured by your Majeſty: but I having leſſe fear of death than deſire of doing good to the common-wealth, bringing theſe wounds to teſtifie the verity of my ſpeech, have adventured upon the clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of your Majeſty to let you know the inſolency of him who dominering over <hi>Rome</hi> debaſeth your glory and authority; and maketh that ſacred name be ſpoken evill of, which otherwiſe would be had in reverence and eſtimation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſtood ſtill a great while after the Prince had ſpoken, being amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the port and animoſity of a youth, at laſt reſenting what my maſter had ſpoken. <hi>Sejanus</hi> ſhall not long abuſe us thus (ſaid he) Thoſe that were about him, who were all enemies to <hi>Sejanus,</hi> and to his greatneſſe, ſeeing ſo fair an occaſion, confirmed my maſters ſpeech, and ſo irritated the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour that he told them he would do them juſtice.</p>
                  <p>We returned to <hi>Neapolis</hi> where we ſtayed ſome weeks for the ſanation of our wounds, the next news we heard was the death of <hi>Sejanus</hi> by the Emperours order: Goodneſſe can never rejoyce at anothers fall, <hi>Dardanus</hi> no ſooner heard of his death but he bewailed him, as if he had loſt a friend, and repented him that ever he had inſtigated the Empe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But I ſee both the favours and diſpleaſures of Princes can keep no mean, they are alwayes in extreames and fatall. Our wounds being cured <hi>Dardanus</hi> went to ſee the chiefeſt places in the City, and walking by the temple of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors</hi> accidentally met with <hi>Caligula;</hi> He was not ſo glad but my maſter was as ſorry at that accident. <hi>Caligula</hi> embraceing him, you need not fear <hi>Sejanus</hi> now (ſaid he) he hath expiated the fault he hath committed againſt you with his life, you may return now to <hi>Rome</hi> and be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. I did not think ſaid he to find you here, <hi>I</hi> came about ſome buſineſſe to the Emperour but I ſee now 'twas my good <hi>genius</hi> that hath been my conductor, ſince I have met with a happineſſe I did not expect. <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> would preſently have taken his leave of him, having a perfect antipathy againſt him, but <hi>Caligula</hi> would needs accompany him to his lodging. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that beaſt was departed, I fear ſaid <hi>Dardanus</hi> leſt this baſe paederaſtes ſhould make uſe of his authority here ſo neer <hi>Tiberius</hi> and endeavour to force me to conſent to his abominable vice, I am reſolved <hi>Epidauro</hi> to leave this place tomorrow and to return either to <hi>Atheans</hi> or <hi>Byzantium,</hi> for I cannot endure the thought much leſſe the ſight of this <hi>Caligula.

Being at liberty we had time to conſider the wickedneſſe of <hi>Caligula,</hi> and by what meanes we might eſcape this impriſonment. Whilſt we were in theſe conſiderations he came to us and told my maſter that which he had done was only out of fear leaſt he ſhould have left his company, on which his life depende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, &amp; that he ſhould fear no other injury than that of his reſtraint. The Prince not permitting him to go on: do what you can monſter (ſaid he interupting him) but it ſhall be neither priſon nor torment that ſhall make me yield to your monſtrous brutuallity. The Prince was too, angry to be conteſted with, and <hi>Caligula</hi> was faine to depart without more words. He viſited us conſtantly twice a day for a week, but ſeeing there was no perſwading <hi>Dardanus</hi> to hear him ſo much as mention his wicked deſires he departed in a rage and told him that he was reſolved he ſhould never eſcape from that priſon till he had conſented to thoſe embraces he deſired. I was very much troubled for fear <hi>Caligula</hi> would run to extremities and force my maſter to that abhored act, ſearching and trying every bar of the window I at laſt ſound one looſe, which after almoſt a whole dayes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <hi>I</hi> got out of the Faſtning, although it gave no meanes of eſcaping through the window, it being too high and other croſſe barrs hindring, yet we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd it for a weapon againſt the laſt exegent. The next day <hi>Caligula</hi> told the Prince he was reſolved no longer to depricate for a thing which was in his power, and to which he was reſolved to force him. He bid him take his choice whether he would conſent willingly, or be forc'd, for he would ſtay no longer, <hi>Dardanus</hi> was ſo vext that he would not anſwer him one word, but his looks exhibited the averſion he had to his motion. <hi>Caligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> departed, vowing before the morning to have his will. We expected he would be as good as his word, and therefore we would not go to bed that night. <hi>I</hi> gave the Prince the iron bar for his defence, and ſo awaited the pleaſure of <hi>Caligula.</hi> About the middle of the night we heard our priſon dore unlock, and by the torches they brought we ſaw <hi>Caligula,</hi> enter with his ſword drawn, and eight men more with planks and bords. They knew we had no weapons to reſiſt them, and therefore they thought it a very eaſie matter to bind us according to the directions of <hi>Caligula</hi> whoſe ſword was to be their defence. The Prince having a weapon, and ſeeing them weaponleſſe, accounted this conqueſt ſo poor that he would not ſo much as riſe from his ſeat to oppoſe them. Aſſoon as they were entred they made faſt the dore on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, &amp; laying down their planks, joyned them together, at whoſe ends were ſower iron ſtables with loops, into which they had intended to have lock'd the Princes armes and legs, and ſo to have expoſ'd him to the enormous luſt of that poedo. When they had made every thing fit, come (ſaid that brute I mean <hi>Caligula</hi>) we muſt force the modeſty of this young man, who like many virgins will out of pudicity be forced to what they deſire, ſee how he ſits, you need not fear his ſtrugling, with that theſe hangmen advanc'd with every one a cord in his hand, but the firſt as came with in the reach of the Prince, paid for his boldneſſe, the blow being delivered with a ſure hand, and animated by a fury that poſſeſt him at the ſight of <hi>Caligulas's</hi> wickedneſſe, the bar entred his skull and beat his braines into his companions faces. This amazed thoſe pucill ſoules, and the animations of <hi>Caligula,</hi> were to no purpoſe for they did not dare to come within the reach of the Prince his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. <hi>Caligula</hi> with his ſword did his endeavour to deprive the Prince of his life, but he with one blow broke it in the middle, and left him as weapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51633:112"/> as his companions. In the mean time <hi>I</hi> gained the dore and getting thence the Keys, depriv'd them of all hope of flying, after the fall of four of thoſe wretches the Prince told the reſt that they were not to expect their lives but by binding <hi>Caligula</hi> after the ſame manner, as they had purpoſ'd to have bound him. They would have accepted of any conditions for their lives, and they thought this but a poor ranſom, for what they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, they preſently bound <hi>Caligula</hi> and faſtned him to the board, who was ſo enraged that he endeavoured to have tore his own fleſh, but that he could not reach it with his teeth, for his neck, arms and feet were ſo faſt that he could not ſtir any way. After I bound the hands of the other four behind them (who never reſiſted) that they might not unbind <hi>Caligula.</hi> After the Prince had upbraided that monſter ſufficiently with his wickedneſſe we departed (locking the dore after us that they might not purſue us) and left them to be found the next day with ſcorn and laughter. We immediately went to the port, and finding a ſhip juſt at breake of the day bound for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> and putting off, we embarqued our ſelves and with a fair wind arrived on that ſhore, the Prince being extreamly contented at the retaliation <hi>Caligula</hi> had met with.</p>
                  <p>We ſtayed not long on that ſhore, but imbarquing in a veſſell bound for <hi>Byzantium,</hi> we croſt good part of that archipellago, when the uſual Caprichi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of that element diſplay'd it ſelf, and after a long aeſtuation of the waters, our unfortunate veſſell ſtruck againſt a rock on the coaſt of <hi>Cilicia.</hi> We were forc'd to make our arms do the office of oars, and by dividing that liquid element gain that more ſtable and ſollid one. After we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ſhore and had loſt our wearineſſe and wetneſſe by the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we purchaſ'd of the inhabitants of the place, we travelled by land, going directly to the <hi>Propontis,</hi> intending to croſſe over there to <hi>Byzantium.</hi> We were allmoſt at our intended place when we were ſet upon by ten men who lived on the ſpoyle and ruin of others. We oppoſ'd them at leaſt two houres and the incomparable valour of the Prince had lay'd three of them at his feet when they found that he was neither invincible nor invulnerable, for the loſſe of blood at ſo many wounds which he had received had taken away the vigour of his arme, and made his blows but weake and inconſiderable, he was falling to the earth, and thoſe deſperate aſſaſins were about to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate a villany, which would have extracted teares from the eyes of a whole Kingdome, when one arrived at that exigent, who diſſipated thoſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers ſooner than the bright ſhine of <hi>Sol</hi> could the ſmalleſt miſt. That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious one who had his arme and ſword a loft, with an intent to have plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it into the breaſt of the Prince, loſt it before he could execute his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination for the ſword of our deliverer amputing it cloſe to his ſhoulder made it fall at the feet of <hi>Dardanus,</hi> as it were out of humility for his ſuperbous inſurrection.</p>
                  <p>Flying like thunder and lightning amongſt the reſt, he did ſuch actions that muſt needs looſe their glory and their grace by being told by a humane tongue. But two eſcaped his fury for which they were beholden to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility and ſlight. What we had ſeen made us doubt whether it were not <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors</hi> himſelfe, and made us approach him with reverence; but the Prince and our deliverer no ſooner beheld one another, but they fell betwixt each others armes, and with a joy inexpreſſable continued a long time without utterance. To keep you no longer from the knowledge of this content, and wrapt, 'twas his dear friend <hi>Argelois</hi> who ſo fortunately came to our ſuccour, and whoſe ſight, with the conſideration of what he had done, had almoſt cauſed <hi>Dardanus</hi> to expire in his joys. After the firſt ardencies were over, <hi>Argelois</hi> and my ſelf leading the Prince between us, with the help of <hi>Fonteus,</hi> his Squire, we went towards the houſe of <hi>Miletus</hi> a wealthy
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51633:112"/> merchant and father to <hi>Argelois.</hi> By the way we ſaw a man who croſſing the path before us was taking another way, but looking at a diſtance upon us, and ſeeing us lead the Prince with ſome difficulty, he turned towards us, and comming near. I think (ſaid he) that this Gentleman whom you lead is wounded, If you are deſtitute of a chirurgion, being (as I thinke) far from houſes, and if you dare truſt my fidelity, I ſhall apply that which ſhall ſoon ſtop the efflux of his blood which elſe will be much to his detriment. The man comming nearer and looking very earneſtly upon the prince, Oh Gods! (cryed he out) what ſee I here! And with that embraceing his knees, Ah! my prince (ſaid he) have you forgot your ſervant <hi>Chiron.</hi> The Prince at theſe words embraceing him, ask'd after the health of his parents. There is nothing lacking to make them happy, but your company (ſaid he) ever ſince the King heard of your departure from <hi>Athens</hi> he hath ſent moſt of his ſervants to all places, whither he could think you were gon, to ſeek you.

But no remonſtrance ſhaking the reſolutions of <hi>Dardanus,</hi> he wrote a letter to King <hi>Palemon</hi> his father, in which he deſired to be pardoned for the liberty he had taken, and that ſeeing he had ſufficiently profited in his ſtudies, he would give him leave to follow the exerciſe of armes, that if ever he came to poſſeſs that Crown which his father enjoyed, and which he wiſhed might ſit long upon his head; he might know as well how to make uſe of his arms in war, as of his learning in peace, that by the one he might quell the rebellious, and by the other maintain in peace the diſobedient. With this letter he diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Chiron</hi> with hopes of his ſudden return. The day being come wherein <hi>Argelois</hi> according to his promiſe was to meet thoſe forces deſtined for <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> we departed from <hi>Miletus,</hi> the Prince uſing that liberality that evermore accompanieth able and generous ſpirits. <hi>Miletus</hi> and his wife could not reſtrain thoſe tears which natural Love extracted at the abrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſon, whoſe vertue indeed every where acquires the Love of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51633:113"/> the moſt barbarous. When we were come to the place of randezvous the Captain of thoſe Legions, made <hi>Argelois</hi> a <hi>Centurion,</hi> whoſe authority he equally ſhared with the Prince, being at the height of his contentment in having ſo dear and noble a Companion. If it might be lawfull to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate the actions of <hi>Fonteus</hi> and my ſelf, with thoſe of our Maſters, I would tell you that we ſought to imitate them in an affection ſo cordial and intire. <hi>Fonteus</hi> and my ſelf then began that amity, which ever ſince we have kept inviolably, and which cheriſht our duties and love to our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. We having the honour to attend on them, we marched into <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> enduring thoſe hardſhips which are attending on ſudden and hard marches. We there found a potent enemy to deal with, but the courage of the ſoldiers, and I may ſay the valour and judgement of the Prince and <hi>Argelois</hi> made us rather victors, than elſe, though their number al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt trebled ours. <hi>Tiberius</hi> was too ſlack in ſending forces to this war, which was maintained a long time with the ordinary Legions, but at laſt perceiving the conſequence of it, He made <hi>Vitellus</hi> General of all the forces in the <hi>Orient</hi> and Lord Preſident of <hi>Syria.</hi> Whilſt he was gathering his forces together that he might come to us with a conſiderable body, we gained a notable victory againſt <hi>Artabanes,</hi> in which conflict my Prince through the heat thar animated him, had ſo far engaged himſelf, that he was ſurrounded with his adverſaries, and had undoubtedly loſt his life in a <hi>Corona</hi> of two or three hundred <hi>Parthians,</hi> if his tutular Angel the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible <hi>Argelois</hi> had not with a kind of prodigie broke that troop with the force and fury of his arm, and made them know by the terror that he brought, that there was nothing impoſſible for him to effect when the life of his friend was in danger.

Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanes</hi> ſupplying the ſlain with freſh men, made up the breaches we had made, and had got a very conſiderable body before <hi>Vitellus</hi> came to us. Aſſoon as he was come, he gain'd in <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> to aſſiſt him, King of <hi>Hybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> to whoſe troops thoſe were adjoyned which <hi>Argelois</hi> led. We came at laſt to a battel with <hi>Orodes</hi> another ſon of <hi>Artabanus,</hi> and one whoſe valor was much eſteemed. <hi>Dardanus,</hi> that day made himſelf remarkable by the terror which he carried where ever he went. He had cut himſelf a way through the midſt of his enemies, and with a lane of dead bodies came where <hi>Orodes</hi> was animaring his men, and both by words and deeds inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateing them not to ſink under the force of their enemies. To him the Prince buckled, who entertained him with courage and skill, a long while they fought, hemmed in with intermingled troops of <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who for the defence of theſe two leaders made the greateſt conflict of the battle. <hi>Dardanus</hi> at laſt wounded <hi>Orodes</hi> in many places, who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly died by his victorious hand, had not a freſh ſupply thundred in amongſt us, ſeeing the danger of their Prince, and carried him wounded as he was from under the ſword of the Prince. It was on him they ſent all their fury, for ſleying thoſe that oppoſed them, they hemmed him in, and thought to have triumphed over his life with their numbers. <hi>I</hi> that was bound to follow him, accompanied him in that exigent, and ſaw thoſe marvels he did, which ſhould <hi>I</hi> relate, they would make you think I <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolized</hi> his actions, or ſpake more by the rule of my affection than the verity of them. So many death-giving weapons which ſurrounded him, were not able to take away his life, the boldeſt ſell under his ſword, and ſerved for Rampers of defence againſt other invaders, he defended himſelf, though wounded in many places, and drowned in blood and ſweat. It was
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51633:113"/> impoſſible but he muſt have yielded to their number, wounds, loſs of blood, and ſaintneſs, and at laſt have fell amongſt the extinct, if <hi>Argelois</hi> had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, who hearing of the danger of the Prince broke thorow with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute followers, and there doing ſome of his uſual wonders. gave life and freedome to <hi>Dardanus,</hi> and an abſolute victory to the <hi>Romans.</hi> By theſe, and other exploits <hi>Argelois</hi> and <hi>Dardanus,</hi> acquired ſo great fame amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they thought them ſomewhat more than men, and gave them more applauſes than their modeſties would permit them to take. The moſt nobleſt ſought to acquire their friendſhip, and both the Generals and Souldiers ſought to give them teſtimonies of their common reſentments, with their applauſes and civilities.</p>
                  <p>At laſt the <hi>Parthians</hi> were beaten, and <hi>Vitellus</hi> with the chief of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my retired to <hi>Artaxata,</hi> where they made great preparations for the crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Tyridates</hi> King of <hi>Arminia.</hi> At the ſame time the <hi>Clites</hi> a people of <hi>Capadocia</hi> rebelled, againſt whom <hi>Vitellus</hi> ſent <hi>Tribulus</hi> with four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the legionary ſoldiers, with the choiſeſt of the Auxilliaries. This <hi>Tribulus</hi> above all the reſt had in great eſtimation the Prince <hi>Dardanus,</hi> and had ſhewed his affection by his many civilities. <hi>Dardanus</hi> on the other ſide ſhewed that his vertue and his valor had won him to a very great familiarity, and that he preſered him to all the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Army. There being now no longer occaſion of ſhewing their valor in <hi>Arminia,</hi> that being the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cauſe of their jorney they put themſelves amongſt the forces of <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> who extraemely joyfull of their company, told them, that he account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his enemies already ſlain, fince he was accompanied with that valor that was invincible. He gave them the cheif command under himſelf, and by many other civilities made it appeare that his love and affection was ſincere.</p>
                  <p>You muſt not doubt but that thoſe people we went againſt, were ſoon over come having to deal with the conquerers of Nations and the two invincible youths, my Prince and <hi>Argelois.</hi> We indeed routed them and quieted that nation notwithſtanding thoſe ſcopuloſous and nemoroſous places which ſheltred them from our fury. <hi>Dardanus</hi> and <hi>Argelois</hi> ſhewing their valour dayly to be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with their travel and labour, made <hi>Tribulus</hi> for the good ſervice they had done him to build two trophies on the two hills, <hi>Codrus</hi> and <hi>Dava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> on both which they had exhibited the utmoſt a mortall arme could be able to effect. Valour hath a ſecret force in gaining of hearts, and cauſing Love, but not only the valour of theſe two <hi>heroes,</hi> but their amiable cariage, and pleaſing converſation had ſo won <hi>Tribulus,</hi> that he wiſht his enimies yet to ſubdue that he might longer have enjoyed their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>For theſe warrs being finiſhed the Prince reſolved to return, that he might eaſe the hearts of ſo many hundreds that languiſhed in his abſence. Before we leſt the generous <hi>Tribulus</hi> he opened (as I may ſay) the ſecrets of his heart to the Prince, and diſcovered ſome things conſerning the Princeſs <hi>Eliana</hi> which but few in the world knew of beſides himſelf, and ſhewing him letters which he had received from his wife at <hi>Rome,</hi> complained much againſt the inſolencies of <hi>Piſo</hi> ſon to the murtherer of <hi>Germanicus.</hi> Theſe freedomes cauſ'd the Prince to diſcover himſelf to him and to proffer him the ſhelter of his fathers court againſt thoſe enimies Fortune had raiſed him.</p>
                  <p>And promiſed him to go and viſit <hi>Eliana,</hi> and to be her guardian till he could diſengage himſelf from thoſe warrs to come to <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe generoſities cauſed <hi>Tribulus</hi> to embrace the Prince, and to deſire his pardon for that his ignorance had made him not to treat him as a Prince. <hi>Tribulus</hi> ſeing
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:51633:114"/> 
                     <hi>Dardanus</hi> his reſolutions gave him his tables for his wife, and after a thouſand embraces and expreſions of the neareſt amity he parted from the Prince, and <hi>Argelois;</hi> leading his victorious troops towards <hi>Artaxata</hi> to meet with <hi>Vitellus,</hi> we preſently began our journy to <hi>Rome,</hi> and before we came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prince accidentally heard that <hi>Caligula</hi> had employ'd abundance of emiſſaries for the finding of a man that had abuſed him in <hi>Neapolis,</hi> whoſe head he had ſet a large price upon, and that he had offered large ſummes for a <hi>Praemium</hi> for him that could bring him either alive or dead. The Prince perceiving the danger he ran in entring <hi>Rome,</hi> would not for all that breake a promiſe which he had made to <hi>Tribulus,</hi> but ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guizing himſelf under the habit of a woman, my ſelf aſſuming that of her waiting maid, we entred that <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> which infer'd chaines on all the world, <hi>Argelois</hi> owning the Prince, for his wife. We ſpent ten days very ſecurly, but all our endeavours to find out the wife of <hi>Tribulus</hi> was in vaine for ſhe had forſaken her houſe and was retired ſo ſecretly that none of her friends could give us any directions where to find her. We had given over that inveſtigation and were about to leave the city, when in viewing the pallaces and other rarities of the City <hi>Caligula</hi> had eſpied the Prince in his womaniſh habit, but not knowing him, he ſent one of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He preſently coming to <hi>Argelois</hi> with a great deal of Eloquence, begun his civilities, and acquaintance, to which <hi>Argelois</hi> anſwered in very obliging termes, and reſolved all his queſtions with extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary fictions. That brute at laſt caſting his eye on my Prince, Your wife ſaid he to <hi>Argelois</hi> doth ſo much reſemble a man that lately did me the greateſt injury in the world, that did not you aver her to be your wife I ſhould thinke 'twas that impoſtor under a female habit. He parted after theſe words, and we not miſtruſting the leaſt from that diſſimulator, (who verily is one of the greateſt in the world) paſſed along, laughing to ſee how neatly we had beguiled him. But whether it were the extream beauty that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the Prince under that dreſſe, or whether the ſame face now more beautifully garniſhed, ſtirr'd up the hidden fire of <hi>Calugula</hi> I know not, but ſo it was he was all on fire, and in Love with the wife of <hi>Argelois,</hi> and before we could gain our lodging met us again with ſo many men that in ſpite of all the Reſiſtance of <hi>Argelois,</hi> he forc'd us two counterfeit females from him leaving him almoſt dead with the wounds he had received in our defence, having no other guard than his ſword, we were preſently carried to a ſtrong houſe as priſoners, but not knowing whether we were diſcovered or noe, we counterfeited the woman as much as we were able. After thoſe that had brought us thither had left us within the liberty of ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all chambers rich enough to have entertained a princeſſe, and ſtrong enough to have retained a <hi>Hercules, Caligula</hi> came to us, haveing dreſt up and perfumed his deformed and rotten carcaſe, that had my miſtres been in Love with clothes and perfumes ſhe had there met with the object of her deſires.</p>
                  <p>He approached her with a great deale of reſpect, and told her, that 'twas only Love had made him commit that violence, which was contrary to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and diſpoſition, and that deity had not wounded him by halves, but that he had beſtowed all the dartes in his quiver upon him, ſo that he was all wounds, and all flames, and that no other hands than hers could recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate him. The Prince making but a jeſt of this danger, ſeeing he was not diſcovered was reſolved to play upon him, and faining not to underſtand him: Sir (ſaid ſhe) I am very ill acquainted with the language of <hi>Rome,</hi> and I know not how to interpret words that cary another ſence with them:

Sir (reply'd my Prince) I can never truſt a double tongue, for how can I believe him that ſpeaks one thing when he means another?

(ſaid the counterſit madam) you told me flames ſignify Love, what doth Love ſignify? adoration and affection (ſaid <hi>Caligula</hi>) you will make me believe that I am ſome divinity anon (ſaid the prince) I do not love to be ador'd, and therefore ſurceaſe thoſe termes leſt being taken for a Goddeſſe I ſhould be fixed to ſome altar, and there ſtarved to death with devotions. <hi>Caligula</hi> was between vext and pleaſ'd with theſe kind of anſwers, but whileſt he was conſidering what to returne, the prince remembring in what condition he had left <hi>Argelois,</hi> left theſe rallaries, and told <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula,</hi> that if he lov'd her as he ſaid, or did ever expect any thing at her hands he ſhould ſend immediatly to ſee what was become of her husband. <hi>Caligula</hi> told her he would do that, and any thing elſe ſhe would command, and leaving us ſent his ſervant to ſee after <hi>Argelois,</hi> but all their diligence could not find him, nor hear whether he was alive or dead. This news extreamly afflicting my prince, made him conſult which was the beſt way we could take for our eſcape, and finding our priſon too ſtrong to be broke, we found it the beſt way as to counterfeit a compliance with <hi>Caligula</hi> and by that means enlarge our freedome. We were honorably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and lack'd nothing but our liberties, and that monſter ſeemed ſo far in Love with the Prince that he was never out of our companies, he ſought to rectify nature, and to cover thoſe deformities which made him diſpleaſing with art and care. He fell at laſt to doting, and rendring himſelf to the will of his miſtres, became an abſolute lover. Aſſoon as ever he could eſcape from his wife he was with us, where he ſpent moſt part of his time in diſcourſes as ridiculous as impertinent. At laſt he gave us the liberty of a garden to walk in, and permitted me to go into the City to fetch any thing my miſtris wanted, when he ſaw that ſhe began to underſtand him, and to give him hopes of obtaining his deſires. I ſought all <hi>Rome</hi> but could not hear of <hi>Argelois,</hi> which made the Prince fear he had been dead, and gave him the true feelings of the greateſt trouble could be raiſ'd by the neareſt amity. We had been now a month in this impriſonment, when I being permitted to go into the City bought two ſcaling ladders made of ſilke twiſted, that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51633:115"/> I might carry them undiſcover'd, with theſe we had plotted to have got over the garden wall, which was very high, and ſo have eſcaped, but we were never left there alone, but either himſelf or ſome other company was with us, which fruſtrated our intent. The Prince knowing no other means to eſcape, feigned to be overcome by that monſter, and promiſed that night to admit him into her chamber, but feigning a modeſty, deſired him, not to let any be privie to his eſcape, and to ſatisfy her fear, made him promiſe to ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcure thoſe in the houſe from coming to the knowledg of her amoreta's. His thoughts prelibateing his pleaſure, preſently teſtified his Joy in his eyes, and promiſ'd to perform every thing punctually. The night being come the Prince reſolved to ſhew him that he had more ſtrength than an ordinary femal cuting the cords of our bed with which we had reſolved to bind him; we a waited his coming, haveing a taper burning in the roome.</p>
                  <p>He ſail'd not to come as he had appoynted, but finding my miſtris up, I hope madam (ſaid he) that you have not chaing'd yours reſolutions, and out of the higheſt of my contentments, to ſling me into the greateſt miſſeries by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying me the fruition of that happineſſe which I hop'd this night to have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt. Feare need not cauſe this change, for I aſſure you I have taken ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that your ſelf could not deſire more. No <hi>Caligula</hi> (ſaid my Prince) <hi>I</hi> hold my reſolutions. Still, and you ſhall enjoy thoſe embraces you ſo much deſire. With that riſing up he call'd me, and taking the cords out my hands. You ſhall ſee <hi>Caligula</hi> what a femal ſtrength is able to do. <hi>Caligula</hi> was ſo amaz'd at this action that he ſtood immovable till the Prince had taken hold of his hands. But when he ſaw that his miſtres had an intent to bind him, between ſmiling and frowning not knowing whether to take it in jeſt or anger, he went to thruſt her from him but he met with a ſtrength that was not ſo eaſily to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſt, <hi>Cailgula</hi> (ſaid the Prince) you have been mightily deceived in taking me for a woman, theſe hands ought to be fatall to you for your enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, I am the ſame that heretofore by your own inſtruments bound you to the planchets, when you had intended a crime againſt nature and Heaven. With that flinging him on the flore bound both his hands and feet together not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his ſtrugling and force. When he had bound him ſo that he could not ſturr, your life (ſaid the Prince) is now at my mercy, but I ſpare it in hope that by theſe exemplar exhibitions of the juſtice of the Gods, ye will leave you crimes and not force them to greater ſeverities after your contempts of their mercies. With this we left him raging mad for this capricio of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and finding the way open into the garden mad uſe of our ſcaleing lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and ſo eſcap'd. The next day chainging our habits into that proper to our ſex, we left <hi>Rome</hi> with the earlieſt light, and taking ſhiping at the mouth of the <hi>Tyber</hi> we embarqued for <hi>Byzantium,</hi> where being arived you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with what Joy, and tryumph the Prince was receiv'd after ſo long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But he not finding <hi>Argelois</hi> there, whom he had hoped might (if he had eſcap'd) have gon theither was ſo dejected that he was not ſenſible of thoſe pleaſures they prepared for him, and would certainly have once more ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his life in <hi>Rome</hi> to have heard of his friend, if his arivall with <hi>Tribulus</hi> and <hi>Eliana</hi> had not diverted it, and filled him with that Joy his preſence all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways brought with it. They were all entertained according to the deſires of the Prince, <hi>Argelois</hi> as his friend, favourite and deliverer, <hi>Tribulus</hi> to his eſtate and condition, <hi>Eliana</hi> as a Princeſſe and daughter to the Kings ancient friend and ally. They had not been longe at the court before the beauty ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and comly grace of that Princeſs, though left deſtititute of a crown through the uſurpation of the <hi>Romans,</hi> gained ſo the heart of the King and Queen that they thought her a match fit for my Prince <hi>Dardanus,</hi> on which there hath been many treaties with <hi>Tribulus</hi> who is to diſpoſe the princeſſes mind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, who without doubt will not deny to her ſelfe ſo great happineſſe. The
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:51633:115"/> King is allready preparing for this mariage, at which will be thoſe tryumphs, which this part of <hi>Aſia</hi> never yet beheld.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Lonoxia</hi> had made known the pleaſure they received by this relation, and had given <hi>Epedauro</hi> thankes for his paines, they went to <hi>Argelois</hi> whom they found amidſt his ordinary muſings in the place where they left him. 'Twas almoſt night, and therefore contracting his ſtay after ſome ordinary diſcourſe he would have took his leave of them, but they proffering to waite on him to the utmoſt limits of their praecincts, they went forth into the Grove together. <hi>Euripides</hi> joyning himſelf to <hi>Argelous</hi> went a little before <hi>Lonoxia</hi> and <hi>Epidauro.</hi> Sir (ſaid he ſoftly to <hi>Argelois,) I</hi> cannot blame this ſadneſſe which I read in your face, <hi>I</hi> am very ſenſible of your affliction. Love and generoſity make a kind of war in your breaſt, the one pleads againſt <hi>Dardanus</hi> the other ſpeakes for him. I confeſſe <hi>Fortune</hi> could have found out nothing more Croſſe, than to make your great friend, deprive you of that felicity you might have expected in obtaining <hi>Eliana.</hi> The Gods can wittneſſe (ſaid <hi>Argelois</hi> ſighing) that I could never frame a thought of ſo much happineſſe to my ſelf. No <hi>Euripedes</hi> that were too high preſumption. I am criminall enough in Loving, which yet may have ſome Colour of pardon, for that it is not in my Power to forbid, but thoughts being at my own diſpoſe would render me in the higheſt degree guilty, ſhould I to pleaſe my fantaſie think of any other happineſſe than that of being her ſlave and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Sir (ſaid <hi>Euripedes</hi>) your have not acquitted your ſelf of the promiſe you made, which was the Relation of thoſe remarkable paſſages you have run through; what we have heard from <hi>Epidauro,</hi> and which was contingent with the Life of <hi>Dardanus</hi> is defective, though by the pleaſure we received in that, we may judge what we ſhall receive in the relation of the whole. I will not contradict your error (ſaid <hi>Argelois</hi>) though <hi>I</hi> can aſſure you there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left worthy of your audition, becauſe I hope it may prove attractive, to draw you paſt the limmits of your domicile, to viſit that place where I reſide, where I engage, if the hearing of my fortune can do it, to give you that content you propoſe to your ſelf. You may be ſure (ſaid <hi>Euripedes</hi>) it ſhall not be long e're I obtain it, ſeeing it may be ſo eaſily purchaſed. As they were about to proceed in their diſcourſe, they heard the ſound of certain voyces which by the cicumlation in the aire ſtrook their eares. Stopping that they might the better hear from whence the ſound came, they heard the grons of a man which with a plaintive voyce ſeem'd to ſpeak to ſome injurors. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of helping the diſtreſſed, as well as Curioſity cauſ'd this ſmall company to preſſe through the thickeſt of the trees, following the ſound by their eares: they paced a great way amongſt the trees, which being ſo thick debarred them of the ſight of the men whoſe voyces they had heard. They were come very near when ſtopping, they heard very diſtinctly theſe words. Obſtinate man! (ſaid one) is it not better for you to give me the knowledge of what <hi>I</hi> deſire than to endure theſe torments? when what you preſerve is for a man whom you have ſought for in vain theſe five years, and whom without hope of ever finding, and your ſelf believing him dead, have given over your ſearch? Leave being thus injurious to your ſelf, and diſcloſe that treaſure which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe muſt periſh with your ſelf. Wee'lſhare it betwixt us, and I promiſe you more than enough to make you happy for ever, if not, more rigorons torments than theſe ſhall force you at laſt to confeſſe or elſe death ſhall aſſault you by my hand. Cruell and falſe wretch! (replyed the other) think not that either your flatteries or your threates ſhall be able to extort that from me which <hi>I</hi> am reſolv'd never to diſcloſe. All the torments that you are able to inflict my fidelity to my maſter ſhall make me able to bear.

               <p>All thoſe looſe garments which were but ſlipped on and which hung with a kind of ordered diſorder, ſeemed to him, to make a perfect harmony, and what it may be, might not have been becoming to one leſſe fair and handſome, ſeemed by the luſtre it received from her, very becoming to her. Indeed beauty gives a grace to the ornaments it weares, and in what dreſſe ſo ever it appears 'tis ſtill raviſhing and charming, there is none though never ſo ugly that can detract from its luſtre, and through which it will not ſhine with a ſplendency able to overcome it. 'Twas not cloathes that made her, but ſhe that made her cloaths beautifull. And as the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ornaments cannot contribute beauty to a face in which there is none, ſo the meaneſt cannot detract from a beauty of it ſelfe naturally ſweet; though <hi>I</hi> confeſſe ornaments are not without their peculiar graces and ſettings oſt to meaner beauties, but <hi>Eliana</hi>'s was ſo tranſcendent, that as the meaneſt dreſſe could not detract from her beauty, ſo the richeſt could adde nothing to it. <hi>Argelois</hi> being diverted by <hi>Panthea</hi> from beholding that faire skin, which carried albitude extraordinary, and a heate, through the gentle live of her bed which concorded with that of his heart, he walked ſome turnes with thoſe fair Princeſſes's, and telling them the reaſon of his ſtay, the laſt night, made them acquainted with his engagement that day to viſit <hi>Euripedes. Panthea</hi> unwilling to be deprived of his company ſo long, deſired to accompany him, and propoſing it to <hi>Eliana,</hi> ſhe conſenting, they told him their intentions. I had thought Madam (ſaid he to <hi>Eliana</hi>) that you durſt not have adventured into thoſe woods again, conſidering the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger you were in the laſt time you ſee there. You ſee therefore (ſaid ſhe) I fear nothing under your protection. <hi>Panthea</hi> interpoſing told them they ought not to let <hi>Euripedes</hi> expect <hi>Argelois,</hi> whilſt they ſpent the time in thoſe diſcourſes, and give him cauſe to thinke he was capable of breaking this word. <hi>Eliana</hi> following her councill they left him, joyful that he ſhould enjoy their company, and went to put on thoſe robes ſutable to their qualities and eſtate. They ſpent little time in dreſſing them, having but very little humour to that court vanity, and yet their ornaments wee ſo rich that they ſeemd to vie with their beauties. <hi>Eliana</hi> had dreſt her ſelf like one of the <hi>Nimphs</hi> or the goddeſſe <hi>Flora,</hi> and as if ſhe meant to ſute with the time of the year, ſhe had put on a gown of a verdant hew branched with leavs and flowers ſo artificially, that they made raire knots and poſes which ſerved for compartments to her gown. <hi>Panthea's</hi> was a bright azure, in which ſhone ſo many bright ſtones that it repreſented the firmament in its greateſt luſtre of ſtarrs, and by the which ſhe would have intimated the conſtancy and charity of her affection. Having ſent for <hi>Argelois</hi> they entred a clariot, and putting off their traine took none with them but <hi>Tribulus</hi> and their two confidents, with the ſquires of <hi>Dardanus</hi> and <hi>Arge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois.</hi>

You will not increpat me for my ſtay (ſaid <hi>Argelois</hi>) ſeeing <hi>I</hi> have brought ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that may excuſe it.

After I had a while conſidered it, <hi>I</hi> was about to depart, when perceiving the laſt letter of the name to be made different from the reſt, by a more notable character. I took more notice of it, and preſently found that <hi>Suretara</hi> was read backwards <hi>Araterus.</hi> Immediately calling <hi>Araterus,</hi> who
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:51633:120"/> was gone to the mouth of the cave, I told him that praediction belonged on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, and therefore I deſired him to relege it. Smileing at my words he did it, but not finding what I had done ask'd me the reaſon why I ſaid ſo. I preſently ſhewed him his name, and told him that with out Contradiction the wiſe <hi>Druide</hi> had foreſeen his fortune, as well as his coming thither. He could not deny but that was his name, but yet he could give no credit to the Praediction, but rather believ'd that 'twas his fortune to be ſtarved in the Iland. Whatſomever he thought, I could not get it out of my mind, but reviſiting the place, I made it a potion againſt deſpaire, placeing a faith on what <hi>I</hi> deſir'd might be, for deſire is apt to cauſe a belief on any thing that may ſeem correſponding to it.</p>
                  <p>We were become mere skeletons, and my ſaith began to waver, when traverſing the ſands on the ſide of the Iland, more out of uſe than hope of ſeing any deliverance, Fortune or rather Providence, permitted the fury of that liquid Element, to caſt a ſhip into a harbour of that Iland. We ſoon made known the miſeries we had endured, our faces teſtifying to the verity of our ſpeeches. They admitted us into their ſhip, and being of <hi>Africa,</hi> aſſoon as the impetuoſity of the ſtorme was allaid, which by its ſudden ceaſing ſeem'd created for our preſervation, we hoiſed the ſailes before the adjuvating winde, bidding adieu to the Iland, but not to our miſeries: For we had not been long on the ſea, before we were aſſaulted by two ſtout Pirates. <hi>Araterus</hi> was too weak to make any reſiſtance, and thoſe in the ſhip too few to withſtand their aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo that we were all made priſoners without any great labour. <hi>Araterus</hi> and my ſelf were put into a Cabbin, where we found amongſt other priſoners the captain of that ſhip which brought us to the deſolate Iland. Having ſaluted him in Greek he told me that whilſt we were gon into the Iland thoſe pirates which had taken us priſoners having diſcryed our ſhip, made to them, and in ſpite of all their reſiſtance took them priſoners with the barque, and conveighing them to a peninſula on the coaſts of <hi>Africa</hi> not far from the greater <hi>Atlas,</hi> they were keept cloſe priſoners, excepting when theſe rovers ſcoured the ſeas, they were put into the ſhip to uſe the owers when they were be calmed. To this peninſula we were had, being the habitation of theſe pirates, and a place that the Conſpirations of Nature and Art had made impregnable. There was from the ſea but one admittance, all other places riſeing with high cliffs were butterreſſes ſufficient to keep of the invaſions of men, or waters. This admittance was by a river deep enough to carry ſhips of burthen: on each ſide of which the declineing rocks made a kind of Arch, on which with certain ginns there placed, two men by letting down ſtrong peices of timber framed Croſs wiſe, were able to impede the entrance of any ſhip, On this place they kept continual gaurd, and from whoſe ſummit they could diſcry all ſhips in the ocean for many Leagues. Being admitted we ſailed up the river into the midſt of the peninſula, in which place, through a great breach there was made a very ſafe and ſpacious bay. Here diſimbarquing we were chained to certain barges, and rowed up to the neck of land which adjoyned it to the main, and through which the river ran. In this place thoſe pirates had built a fort with a wall and dike from one ſide of the neck to the other, whereby they had made themſelves impregnable. In this place we were impriſoned amongſt others which they had taken, where we endured their indignities all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a twelve month. <hi>Araterus</hi> had ſufficiently enquired into the Condition of the Iland and their captain: He felt the pulſes of many beating towards a change. And the perceived that nothing but want of an opportunity and introductions hindred their motion. Their captain was covetous, cruell, and unjuſt, depriveing them of their rights and liberties, and induceing a Tiranny without controulment. <hi>Araterus</hi> aſſoon as he had found their alienation augmented it by the charmes of his voluble tongue, and telling

That the Gods had created them free, and had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed no ſuch tyranny upon them. That Kings, Lords, or Tyrants, were not firſt made and then others, for to be their ſlaves, but that the Gods made them Lords of the earth, and all the creatures: That one ought not to uſurp ſuch authority over another: that they were coequall with their captain, and that 'twas no other thing but ſubtilty and ambition that at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed this coequality.

And that their Captain contrary to all this had uſurp't an authority not given him, that he had dealt cruelly with them, that he depived them of their goods: that he made ſlaves of their perſons, and that in following the dictates of his ambitious deſires he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſomething more than they could be able to beare; that then they would ſeek to eaſe themſelves too late, after that with gifts, promiſes, hopes and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he had tyed enough to his intereſt to make him formidable to the reſt, and laſtly if they did not deſire to be enſlaved 'twas no hard matter at that time to give a period to his ambition and their own thraldome. I ſay by inculcating theſe maxims into thoſe that were ready enough to imbibe them, he inſpir'd them with reſolutions, which they followed and effected.</p>

                     <hi>Araterus</hi> in this ſought not only his liberty, but to have it accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with their ruin, which he could eaſily judge, would be effected by his counſel, for the confuſion into which it would bring them, would induce their extermination.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Praedonians</hi> fired with their reſolutions ſoon augmented their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and beholding the actions of their Captain with a prejudiced eye they aggravated to the degree of hainous whatſomever he committed. Being no longer able to reſtrain their fury, they rebelled under the notion of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and breaking the priſon made all thoſe retained therein on their ſide. They make <hi>Araterus</hi> their Captain, and with that impetuoſity which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies ſudden and temerary actions aſſaulted their Captain, who at the firſt inckling having gained a party, met them with little leſſe fury. All the Pirats were ingaged in either party, it being too great a ſhame for any to remaine neuters: ſo that almoſt half of them fell at the firſt encounter. There was on our party one wiſer than the reſt, who perceiving the effect of their loſſe, and foreſeeing their ruin if they perſiſted, began to ſtop their fury by laying open the inſulties of their actions; He told them that their actions had rendred them odious to their neighbours, and that being moſt of them baniſht men, they dared not to return to their own Countryes: and that if they thought to live in others they muſt become ſlaves to the natives. That they had choſen a place, in which fertility and commodity reſided, that out of ſeverall <hi>Nations</hi> they had compoſed one little Colony, which for many years had been maintained with eaſe and a little valour, which he foreſaw muſt be left: for that they could not be able to maintain it, they depriving one another of their lives. That they lived too happily, becauſe 'twas wantonneſſe had cauſed this diſtaſt at their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains actions, who he confeſt had taken too much liberty yet not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable with their rebellions: that though the head were infected they ſhould not preſently kill the body or cut it off, but ſhould have recourſe to meanes ſutable to the diſeaſe. That they might have repreſt their captaines au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority without ſlaying one another, upon the advice of a priſoner who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

He would have gon on but that <hi>Araterus</hi> having receiv'd notiſe of it and knowing, that the ſpeech of a wiſe man might eaſily overthrow his <hi>Maxims,</hi> and deterre his deſigns, ran preſently to the place, and crying out he was a traytor to their liberties that he was ſuborn'd by their Captain and that he deſerved immediatly to dye, converted the hearts of the wavering multitude, and inſpired them with their firſt fury. They immediatly ſtoned him to death as a traytor, and inſinuator, ſhewing by that action how incapable the common prople are to judge of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and making that <hi>Maxim</hi> good which ſaith they are a moſt violent torrent, full of mutability and inſtability, doing all their actions with te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity and precipitancy. This obſtacle being removed <hi>Araterus</hi> purſuing his deſigns placed all the priſoners in a band by themſelves, and gave them moſt commonly the rereward, that he might leſſen them as little as he could. Not caring much which ſide overcame ſo their men were but leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: he ingaged them in very deſperate incounters, in the laſt of which they ſlew their <hi>Captain. Araterus</hi> now fearing their agreeing moſt ſubtilly ſowed theſe ſeeds of diſcord that he expected the crop of his deſires, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the one demand unreaſonable termes of the other, and by ſending me ſerectly to the other party to manifeſt to them his affection to ſee their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and that his party demanded unreaſonable ſatisfaction contrary to his deſires, and that they did not intend to proſecute it if they ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves reſolved to withſtand them, and that they ſhould ſend to demand higher reparations of them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and other practiſes being agitated by <hi>Araterus</hi> bred ſo great a feud between them, that they came to another battel by which they were ſo leſned that he believed he might effect his deſire Thoſe that remained of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party gain'd that which they called the <hi>Impr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This they will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly agreed to, being their eyes were to be judges that <hi>Araterus</hi> ment not to fain. He had yet communicated this to none but my ſelf, but in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holding his party in hand that he would effect ſome ſtrange ſtratagem, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to embattell themſelves, and that they ſhould be ready to engage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in a falſe skirmiſh before the fort, telling them that he doubted not but their enemies ſeeing it and believing they were fallen out amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would ſally forth hopeing to obtaine a notable victory, and by that means betray themſelves into their hands. The pirates never imagining his deceit, having ſeen him hitherto ſo cordiall, and active in all encounters applauded it as a notable ſtratagem. Prepareing for this buſineſſe he drew out the band of priſoners, telling them that it would colour the ſtratagem the better from their enemies, and leaving them inſtructions what to do, he with drew out of the fight of the reſt of the pirates and ſeeing none with them but thoſe that had been priſoners he told them what he had done, letting them know he was in earneſt and not in jeſt, that they after had deſtroyed thoſe, they ſhould enter the fort where they ſhould extirpe the laſt of that viperous brood. He aggravated their crimes, and how pleaſing 'twould be to the Gods, and how acceptable to men. The unlawfulneſſe of their actions, and cruelties of their natures, he extold their valour, told them he enduced them to

The ſenſe of their miſeries and indignities received ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated ſome to revenge, and others accounting it an act meritorious to extirpate ſuch deſtroyers of human ſociety, were excited to perpetrate it, ſome out of fear to be repugnant, and others out of compliance, ſo that there was none diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting but all gave him their hands to do their utmoſt for their in exterma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Araterus</hi> preſently appearing was met with a falſe skirmiſh according to his appointment, but they found to their coſt that 'twas a true one; they ſaw they were betrayed when 'twas too late to help themſelves.

Theſe people which at firſt ſight ſeem'd like ſo many <hi>Daemons</hi> affrighted thoſe in the ſhip, who naming the place the land of Devils, would rather have endured the miſerie of ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, than to expoſe themſelves to the mercy of ſuch Creatures. <hi>Araterus</hi> wearied of the ſea, perſwaded them to go on ſhore without fear, telling them without doubt that thoſe creatures were humane, and of neceſſity they muſt periſh, or gain ſome ſuſtenance at their hands. At laſt he perſwaded them to land, which they did, but were oppos'd by thoſe blacks, who at a diſtance ſhot at them arrows, the points made ſharp, and hardened in the fire (for they had not the uſe of Iron or Steel, which wounded many, and ſlew ſome: But <hi>Araterus</hi> encouraged them, and with great hazard to his perſon fell in amongſt them, who affrighted at us, and our glittering weapons, with a terrible howling and noiſe ſled from us; ſome of them we ſlew, whereby the people of the ſhip were ſatisfied, that they were poor, ſimple, naked people, rejoycing that they were landed, they quenched their thirſts with a river that we found, and ſtopt their hunger with ſome wild fowl which we caught, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other cooking, than roſting it againſt the Sun.</p>
                  <p>We had but juſt ſatisfied our ſelves with our late caught food, when we perceived coming down the mountains, an innumerable company of <hi>Negroes,</hi> who being rear'd by thoſe that ſled from us, came to repell us out of their Countrey. We ſought to retire to our ſhips, when we perceived their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty had deprived us of all hopes of eſcaping, for a whole troop of them getting between us, and the ſhip oppoſ'd our paſſage.

He had hardly buckled it on before we were aſſaulted at a diſtance with a cloud of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, which falling upon his armour rebounded back to the amazement of thoſe that jaculated them. But many of our companions ended their lives in the firſt brunt, for although they were but ſlightly wounded, yet thoſe wounds being made with empoyſoned arrows, they immediately dyed.</p>
                  <p>Diſpair, oftentimes the mother of great exploits, made our companions fight ſo vigorouſly, that they obſcured the earth with their dark bodies, and made a kind of a ſable and ſanguine field. But what avails valour and animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity when 'tis over-powered? ſtrength may be maſtered by a multitude, and courage made effectleſs. The power of theſe Monſters increaſed, and the more we ſlew, the ſtronger they were, by the continual ſupplies that came. It was a kind of miracle to behold how many lay breathing their laſt, and ſlain by ſo ſmall a company. Indeed they were naked and almoſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponleſs, their chiefeſt being empoyſoned arrows and clubs, to whoſe tops were made faſt a kind of ſtones of a plumbeous ſubſtance, but their numbers were ſo great, that the weight of their very armes had been enough to have depreſſed us all to the earth. Our companions ſlew ſo many of them, and had beſpread the whole face of the field with their carcaſes, that had you ſeen them, you would have judged by the <hi>Clades,</hi> that it had been
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:51633:124"/> the depreliation of two great armies. Their ſtrength could not run parallel with their courage; their minds and wills fought, though their armes were no longer able to ſtrike a ſtroke. They fainted, and were ſlain, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come only by their own courages; and with the heat of <hi>Titan,</hi> not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to that ardor which they there felt. They died, but yet with victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and triumph, thouſands lying about them, whoſe ſouls they carried in triumph into the neather world. I had almoſt forgot to tell you <hi>Araterus</hi> is yet invincible, though he cannot wreſt his companions out of the arms of death, he ſees them die with regret, orepreſt with the number of thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneous <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> this inſtigates his fury, and cauſes him to make Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of their carcaſes, and ſable rivers of their blood. There was not any ſurviv'd but <hi>Araterus</hi> and my ſelf, he being my buckler againſt their number, receiving their darts upon his armour that did him no hurt, which ſo amazed thoſe ignorant ones, that they believed him to be invulnerable, and ſeeing the prodigious ſtrokes that he gave on their defenceleſs bodies, they did not dare to come within his reach, but aſſaulted him afar off with their darts and ſlings. <hi>Araterus</hi> at laſt not longer able to endure the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable heat of the Sun, under the burthen of his heavy armour, fainted. They no fooner ſaw him fall, but with a ſtrange howling noiſe they came all running towards him. I was fallen upon my knees to have given him breath, being almoſt diſtracted at the miſery to which we were reduced, yet at laſt recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting my ſelf I hoped by their ignorance to work our delivery. Aſſoon as they came, I ſtrove, by pointing up to the heaven, and then towards <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi> ſeveral times, to impreſs into them that he was ſome celeſtial Deity. They underſtood my meaning, and with a kind of admiration beheld him, touching his armour, and ſtriking their javelins ends againſt it. <hi>Araterus</hi> at laſt coming to himſelf, ſeeing them about him began to ſtruggle, which made them immediatly deprive him of his ſword, and holding him, made a ſhift to bind his hands and feet. Having ſerv'd me in the ſame manner, they carried us upon a kind of a Chariot on their ſhoulders thouſands of them fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing us, making moſt helliſh noiſes. In that manner they carried us two dayes to the Pallace of their King, which ſtood in a wood, built with mud and timber, after a courſe manner. After they had waited ſome time at the gate of the Pallace, we entred a kind of Court in which ſtood a large Tree, under which on a kind of Throne ſat their King naked, having a kind of Diadem made of Oſtridge feathers, with a kind of linnen Mantle about his middle. Round about him ſtood his noble men, who with dejected countenances ſhew'd the reverence they bore to his Majeſty. At his elbow ſtood one different in habit from all the reſt, having a ſtrange kind of fantaſtick garment, compoſ'd of all ſorts of feathers: his head was ſhaven, and covered with a cap of the ſame. This man (as we afterwards underſtood) was the Oracle of the King, and the high Prieſt of the Countrey, and to whoſe Council all adher'd. After the King had with great admiration ſatisfied himſelf with the ſight of <hi>Araterus,</hi> and with feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and trying his darts againſt his armour, he made many ſigns to us, which I ſuppoſing were to know from whence we came, pointed up to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, endeavouring to make them think <hi>Araterus</hi> a god. The Prieſt till then ſtood mute, but ſeeing the King bow his head to <hi>Araterus</hi> he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fearfull ejulation, and afterwards, as if he were poſſeſt, uttered ſome ſpeeches, which we underſtood by the ſignes of the people, and their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten nominating their great God, that he made known, we were to be given for food to their great god <hi>Arqcebuſqez.</hi> Intereſt had poſſeſt him, for ſurely he believed that <hi>Araterus</hi> being taken for a God, he would have been ſome detriment to his order. By the ſigns that were made us, we underſtood our doome, and wondring what their god might be, we expected our expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:51633:124"/> with patience. We were preſently carried into another ſpacious Court, compaſſed about with high poles ſtuck faſt into the ground, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texed with ſmaller ſticks.

By and by we heard a wonderful fibilation, and preſently came forth a monſtrous Serpent, at whoſe ſight the people fell flat upon the earth, as alſo the King and all his black Candidates. <hi>Arate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> at the ſight of that monſter forc'd himſelf ſo ſtrongly, that he broke the bands about his arms, and taking forth a dagger that he had under his Caſſock, cut thoſe that tied his feet, then preſently freeing me, he met that monſtrous ſerpent, and aſſaying his skin in many places could find no entrance for the point of his dagger. The Serpent with his anguinious tail beat him down ſeveral times, which made me fear that he would have yielded his life between the jaws of that <hi>Hydra.</hi> After a long reſiſtance he found the belly of the Monſter paſſible, for plunging his dagger ſeveral times into it, he let out a ſtream of veneniſerous and ſtinking blood, with the life of that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Serpent and falſe Deity.</p>
                  <p>The King, Prieſt and People all amazed at the puiſſance of <hi>Araterus</hi> and the death of their God, expreſſed it by their countenances and poſture. At laſt the oraculous Prieſt ſeeming to be poſſeſt, howled forth certain words which we know by the effects were to perſwade the King that <hi>Araterus</hi> was the chiefeſt Deity in the celeſtial orb, and that <hi>I</hi> was an under god who had left the heavens to attend him, and that he ſhould place us in the Temple, and cauſe us to be worſhiped in the place of that ancient Deity which they had worſhipped ſo long. The King that never contradicted what he ſaid, came into the place to us, and falling on his knees before <hi>Araterus,</hi> with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected hands, which through our ignorance of their language, we could not underſtand. The Prieſt doing the like (whether out of ignorance or ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I know not) engaged all the people to a profound devotion. I perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Araterus</hi> not to contradict them, telling him it was the only way for us to eſcape them. He permitted it with a heart that attributed nothing of it to himſelf, and did but accept it for his own ſafety. After many ceremonies they conducted us to the Temple, where having ſeated us in an high ſeat, placeing me at the ſeet of <hi>Araterus,</hi> there entred many under-Prieſts deck'd after the ſame manner as their High-prieſt, with cenſers in their hands.</p>
                  <p>Theſe fuming us with certain ſweet odors, of a magical operation, ſo ſtupefied us, that we fell both aſleep. In the mean time according to the direction of the high Prieſt, with a kind of hoop made of a fiſhes bone, and bound behind with cords, they faſtened us both to the backs of our ſeats, and our armes they pinion'd in ſuch a manner above the elbows, that we could make no other uſe of them, but to feed our ſelves. In this manner we found our ſelves when we awaked, the Temple clear, and abundance of ſacrifices ſlain, and offered to us on Tables made after a curious faſhion, and almoſt like an Altar. <hi>Araterus</hi> laugh'd, and was angry at the ſame time, to ſee, that whilſt they went about to make us gods, they made us leſs then men. This Prieſt (ſaid he) is more ſubtile then all the Nation beſides, the King, his Candidates and people believe us to be gods, and with the zeal of blind devotion, cordially offer to us their prayers and ſacrificial rites: But this ſubtle Impoſter knows us to be men, and ſeeing that I have ſlain his <hi>Arqcebuſqes</hi> which was the maintainer of his greatneſs, he moſt ſubtilly puniſhes us, and by the puniſhment conſerves his former greatneſs and glory. O blind people! whereby is manifeſt that ignorance is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:51633:125"/> of your devotion: What a ſad thing is it that Religion ſhould be made the decoy of Politicians! ſee but with what awe this impoſtor governs the whole kingdom, under the ſpecious name of Religion, and by it makes thoſe of great capacities to condeſcend to things below ſence and reaſon. He made them firſt worſhip a Serpent of a ſtupendious greatneſs, a very Monſter or devil, and now for all they ſee it was mortal, and therefore no Deity, yet are they brought to another devotion as ridiculous, to adore us men. This power hath Religion, when men deprive themſelves of the eyes of Reaſon, and following the tradition of others, believe the dictates of ſuch impoſtors without examining the verity of them. Whilſt he was ſpeaking thus, there entred the Temple four Prieſts, who with two large chargers, and two veſſels of water kneeled before us, and having mumbled I know not what prayers, they placed the chargers filled with the beſt diet their Countrey afforded, and the water cloſe by us, and ſo departing, left us to ſatisfie our appetites; which we were fain to do, to keep our ſelves from ſtarving. Three weeks ſpace were we thus deified, in which time we were often almoſt choak'd with their fumigations, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to by thoſe Prieſts that were ordained to attend us. <hi>Araterus</hi> uſed all the ſigns he could to prohibit them, but he could not make them underſtand, and every time he did but wag himſelf, the ruſtling of his armour made them in preſence fall proſtrate to the earth, and with grievous ejulations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired this <hi>Mars-</hi>like God to be quiet, and pacified with thoſe oblations they ſhould offer, ſo that his prohibitions ſtill begot new ſacrifies. After three weeks we heard two Prieſts diſcourſing together in the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>Araterus</hi> wondring to hear them ſpeak that language, and having learn'd it in his youth, liſned to their talk. What (ſaid one) do you believe theſe to be gods? I believe them as much gods as the former was (ſaith the other) for that ſteel caſe that one wears, if you remember when we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> we ſaw abundance of the <hi>Romans</hi> wear ſuch. 'Tis true (replyed the other) I alwayes believed them men. But you muſt believe them to be gods (ſaid the other) though you do know that they are men, for thereby our greatneſs is maintained, for ſhould the people think they are men, we are utterly undone, and it was the ſubtilty of our High Prieſt to ſalve his loſs of <hi>Arqcebusqez</hi> with deifying theſe ſtrangers. <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi> no longer able to retain himſelf, ſpake to them in that language, and with words ſo prevalent, that he won them to him, and made them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him to releaſe him, and to ſhift him out of the Countrey. <hi>Araterus</hi> having asked them how they came to ſpeak that language, they told him that being Natives of that Countrey, they were then priſoners by a mighty King their Neighbour, who ſold them amongſt many others to one who carried them into <hi>Lybia,</hi> from whence eſcaping by flight, they went into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where they learned the language and manners of the Countrey, which done, they returned on Cammels, after ſome whole years travel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Countrey, where relating the ſtrange things they had ſeen in their travels to the High Prieſt, he preſently conferred on them the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Prieſt-hood, accounting it a crime for any to be knowing, but thoſe that attended on the Altars of the gods, charging them on pain of death not to diſcover what they had ſeen to any other, ſeeing that the people would become diſobedient, when they ceaſed to be ignorant. And leaſt they ſhould invite others to the like travels, who in time might induce the manners and cuſtomes of other Nations he charged them to forget the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage they had learned, and that ever they had travelled out of their own Countrey. They ſaid that they had obey'd his Commands in every thing, but that, for being loath to forget what they attained to, with the hazard of their lives, they ſometimes diſcourſed together in that language, though in great ſecreſie and fear. After they had promiſed again in few dayes to

Theſe blacks not varying from their word, come the next night, and giving <hi>Araterus</hi> his ſword, which they had ſtole from the high Prieſt, unlooſed us and gave us our liberty. All ſower of us leaving the place ſled allnight, and never reſted till we were out of the Kingdom. The blacks being our guides we travelled thorow vaſt hot countreys, ſometimes or'e mountaines, ſometimes thorow for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, deſerts and ſandy plaines, then over great lakes, not without danger of drowning, or of being killed by the inhabitants, who were liker beaſts than men, or of being devoured by wild beaſts, and immenſe ſerpents. After we had overcome all our difficulties paſſing many ſtrange nations, we came to a ſea that ran far into the globe. There we embarqued, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to have return'd by the <hi>Erythrian</hi> ſea, but being driven beyond the mouth of it with impetuous ſtormes, we at laſt arrived in the <hi>Perſian</hi> gulſe.</p>
                  <p>Having for many weeks incurred the dangers of the Sea, and daunced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe vaſt plaines of waters, we at laſt landed, to refreſh our bodies with the allevaments of the earth. Our pennigerous guides were paſt their own knowledge and as ignorant of thoſe places we had attained to as our ſelves. Thoſe people had not ſuch ſable skinns, nor was the Sun of that force as in the climate of the blacks, but their bodies generally mean of ſtature, and of a ſwarth complexion, had ſomething of handſomneſſe and beauty. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raterus</hi> although he longed to have returned into his own countrey, and though our travells (as all others) were accompanied with danger and peril, yet novelties breeding a deſire, and curioſity, he paſt into the country, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a wonderfull pleaſure in ſeeing the variety of places, people, conditions, manners, and climates. Spatiating for ſome few dayes that region, we paſt a large extent of land, which like a tongue ran far into the ſea. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived on the other ſide we eſpied another large ſea, into which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raterus</hi> would needs commit himſelf, reſolving now to viſit the utmoſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the earth. Indeed we ſtayed very little in a place, but were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually peregrines, not knowing which way to return home. Thoſe ſeas were very dangerous at that time of the year in which we ſailed them, and in few dayes after our imbarquement we were incountered by ſo violent a ſtorme, that 'tis paſt the skill of a better capacity than mine to deſcribe it. The end of it was our ſhipwrack almoſt within ſight of land. The blacks being almoſt halfe fiſhes, and moſt expert ſwimmers, ſcorned thoſe helps we were glad to make uſe of, and truſting to the ſtrength of their armes, and skill in ſwimming advanced before us towards the ſhore.

Having returned thanks to the Gods for our preſervation, and having bewailed our faithfull blacks, and buried him we found dead on the ſand, we went into the country, to know into what place this dire chance had caſt us. We preſently found that we were in a rich ſoile, fruitfull, pleaſant, ſtored with all things fit for life, and ornament, not ſo hot as thoſe countreys we had paſſed, but we perceived we were very near the <hi>Orient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Land was full of Cityes of a vaſt greatneſſe, and Towns ſo ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that they exceeded the quantity of our ordinary Cityes, beſides very
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:51633:126"/> popolous, and well ſtored with delicate woods: and watered with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of rivers. The people were extreamly civill, courteous to ſtrangers, witty, pleaſant, and very well favoured. We found nothing of barbariſme or rudeneſſe there, but all things in a kinde of Harmony, and great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litenneſſe. <hi>Araterus</hi> was extreamly taken with the countrey, being one of the pleaſanteſt he had ever entred. You are not to doubt (ſaid I to him) but that the propheſie of the <hi>Druidae</hi> will be fulfilled, ſeeing that the Gods with miracles have effected thus much of it, we are now in the <hi>Orient,</hi> from whence it ſeems we are like never to return, but 'tis no great matter, ſeeing that you ſhall poſſeſſe ſo rich, pleaſant and fertill a Kingdom, which will be great inducements for your forgetting your native countrey, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when you ſhall be joyned to ſo ſublime a beauty as the prediction ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. I am not (replyed he) ſo much in Love with my country, as that I cannot live any where elſe, if that I ſee the will, and providence of the Gods ſo ordering it; but yet were it now in my election, I ſhould rather chooſe my little eſtate in my native country, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the greateſt monarchy here. But yet I ſhall cede to the will of the Gods, let them prepare what they will for me.</p>
                  <p>And indeed I do not flatter my ſelfe with the accompliſhment of the Praediction, although theſe occurrences might induce me to believe its verity. We had travelled ſome few dayes from the ſea ſide, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves with ſuch like diſcourſes we came to the ſide of a very large river, which rowling down with liquid-ſilvered waves, made us ſuppoſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſea, but that the clearneſſe and freſhneſſe of the water contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that opinion. We travelled up this river with wonderful delight, viewing the ſhips and boats that continually ſported upon its ſurface, till we met one of the country, who by the ſignes we made him to know the name of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, told us 'twas called <hi>Ganges.</hi> This man, ſeeing we were ſtrangers lokt upon us very wiſhly, and finding I know not what pleaſing air in the face of <hi>Aratreus,</hi> he cauſed us to go with him to his houſe which was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate hard by the river, and encompaſſed with a wood, 'twas built flat on the top, after the faſhion of the countrey four ſquare, and of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent bigneſſe. 'Tis impoſſible for you to imagin, with what affection and love this man entertained <hi>Araterus,</hi> and there wanted nothing but language to make their friendſhip compleat, and though 'twas in a mute language that he expreſſed himſelf, yet love was perſpicuouſly, ſeen in every ſign and geſture. In few dayes <hi>Araterus</hi> had ſo won upon our entertainer with his ſweet carriage that he would not permit him to depart, but as we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him by the ſignes he made, deſired us to continue with him, and learn the language of the country. <hi>Araterus</hi> being well content, returned him by ſignes, that he would obey him, and give him thankes, and ſervice for his kindneſſes. Being ſetled in this reſolution, we ſpun out the thread of two yeares, continually obliged to this man for his manifold courteſies and favours. In this time we had both of us perfectly attain'd the language, which ſounded almoſt like the <hi>Arabick,</hi> and our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer accounted himſelf ſufficiently recompenſed with the admirable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes he heard from <hi>Araterus,</hi> and the recitall of his life and fortune. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raterus</hi> having often requeſted him to let him underſtand the condition of the country which he was in, one day as we were in a houſe of pleaſure on the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Ganges,</hi> he acquitted himſelf thus:</p>
                  <p>This country (ſaid he) wherein you are, is one of the faireſt, richeſt, and pleaſanteſt that the glorious ſtar of Day ſees in his perpetuall courſe. If the Gods grant that you reſide amongſt us, you will experience this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſay that 'tis worthy of all <hi>Eulogies</hi> and commendations. I am perſwaded that in the ſmall time that you have been here, and in the like
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:51633:126"/> experience you have had of us, that you cannot but ſee we are no <hi>Scythians</hi> or <hi>Hyperborean</hi> inhabitants, but that there is a certaine politeneſſe in our words and actions. If it were handſome for me to praiſe my own countrey I might expatiate, in the collaudation of its ſite, fertility, delectableneſs, continuall verdure, wholeſomeneſſe, richneſſe and populoſity. Beſides in the conditions of the people, their formofity, gentle nature, virtuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and warlike ſpirit. And laſtly of its government and tranquillity, in which it hath exceeded all the Kingdoms of the Eaſt. But this a little time and experience will manifeſt to you, better and fuller, than the beſt of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> can. I believe <hi>I</hi> ſhall give you ſome ſatisfaction, to tell you briefly in what poſture, at preſent we ſtand. This Kingdome hath by a peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for theſe three hundred yeares been moſt commonly governed by Queens, neither ſex being debarred from the regency, and by our lawes the firſt partus of his or her Majeſty that reignes, is evermore proclaimed ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour to the crown, whether it be male or female, and although many males afterwards be born, yet the firſt ſucceeds although it be a female. The reaſon for this is, becauſe we believe that the Gods haveing the ſole diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the conception and forming of the <hi>Embrio</hi> will create it according to their ſole wills and pleaſures from them as diſpoſed and ordered by them to govern and rule us. But if the eldeſt dye then the next ſucceeds according to the order of their birth.</p>
                  <p>If we have a good Prince we rejoyce and thank the Gods for him, and if we have an evill Prince, believing it to be the wills, and pleaſure of the Gods to have him ſo, we yield to him without murmuring. And if it may be accounted a bleſſing to a Kingdome, as ſure it is to have good and wiſe Princes, we have been extreamly happy, and as I have ſaid, though we have not had but two Kings this three hundred yeares, yet we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed all thoſe bleſſings under the female ſex that we could have expected from the other; the Gods having poured upon them all the influences of the regall and Majeſtick ſtarres, and inſpired them with prudence, and Magnanimity. But leaſt we ſhould receive any detriment by the mariage of our Queens 'twas ſo ordained that they ought to have the conſent of their council, which conſiſts of the chiefeſt men in the Kingdome, before they may contract themſelves to any, but yet this good law hath not alwayes been kept, and many have married without putting it to the councill. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I liked it ſo well that I would have made it to have reached Kings as well as Queens, and I urging it, when the father of our raigning Queen was to be married, being very young, and fearing leaſt he ſhould chooſe one not Qualified for the place, and conſidering that we were in little leffe danger by the marriage of our King as well of our Queens, when they permit them by their affection to incroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their authority: I ſay urging it that the King might be brought under that Law, I gained his disfavour, and being ever after looked upon as one repugnant to his intereſts I was ejected from being one of the councill. I tooke it patiently enough, and retireing from the court have ever ſince en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the ſweets of a private life, without the leaſt aſpiring to my former dignity. He dying about fewer yeares ſince left his daughter (and his only) <hi>Amarillis</hi> to ſucceed, a princeſſe I confeſſe filled with the divinity of the Gods, who beareth the perfect image of themſelves. So glorious and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a beauty our Eaſtern world could never yet glory of, ſhe is beyond compare both in the goods of body and of minde, ſhe is filled with all the rareſt endowments the Gods, and nature could infuſe, and though ſhe hath ſcarce compleated the fifth luſtre of her age, ſhe hath exhauſted all the learning of the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> and <hi>Brachmans.</hi> We have lived hitherto extreamly happy under her raign, ſhe allwayes mixing lenity and prudence
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:51633:127"/> with all her actions, but now ſome evill <hi>Daemon</hi> diſturbing our quietude hath ſet the whole Kingdome into a combuſtion. We are invironed with many great and formidable Princes on all ſides, with whom we have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally kept a very good correſpondence, and maintained our intereſts with poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Moſt of them, ſeeing the beauty of <hi>Amarillis</hi> our Queen ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, have deſired the poſſeſſion of her either for themſelves or their ſons: but ſhe ſhewing her ſelfe averſe from marriage, by her gentleneſſe and good behaviour hath pacified moſt of them. On the <hi>Eaſt</hi> ſide of us is the moſt mighty Kingdome <hi>Sinana,</hi> the greateſt and largeſt in the whole world, being divided into fifteen provinces, every one of which is as big as moſt Kingdomes in the world, the one ſide of it butteth upon ours and runneth all along to the great gulfe of <hi>Bengan.</hi> It is incredible if I ſhould tell you of the number and vaſtneſſe, of their Cityes and towns, and of the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company of people that inhabit them.

Round that large City ran a wall with battlements and tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with about a hundred gates, ſo ſtrong, that it rendred it impregnable on the one ſide, as it was waſht with the river, and the South ſide butted towards a kind of ſine, which breaking forth of the gulf came thorow the City to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace walls, on which continually floted thirty thouſand boats. And though there were ſo many people, and that it was ſo vaſt a City, yet every thing ſeemed ſo decent, &amp; in ſo good order, that in all that ever we had ſeen there was no thing like it. At that inſtant one of <hi>Euripedes</hi> ſervants came to give him notice that their dinner waited on them, which made <hi>Meador</hi> ſtop, and give liberty to <hi>Euripedes</hi> to incite his gueſts to accept of that ſmall repaſt which his Grot could afford. Every one ſhewing the pleaſure they received in <hi>Meadors</hi> relation could hardly be perſwaded to ſpare ſo much time, but at laſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Euripedes</hi> they entred another room, which they found furniſhed ſo deftly, that it expreſſed, he had been one of great eſtate. After the handſome excuſe of <hi>Euripedes</hi> for his mean accommodations for ſo illuſtrious perſons, they fell to their repaſt, which they ſoon finiſhed, having a great deſire to hear the concluſion of <hi>Meadors</hi> relation. After they had dined, they return'd to the ſame place where they were before, and being ſeated <hi>Meador</hi> knowing their deſires, directing his ſpeech as he did before to <hi>Euripedes,</hi> he thus proceeded in his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Having glutted our eyes with beholding the variety of Objects, as we paſſed thorow the City, we came at laſt to the Pallace about the time I have mentioned. Having provided for our horſes in thoſe houſes for entertainment, we went to view the Pallace, which we found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with the reſt of the City, full of ſtate, and the ſtructure mixed with ſtrength and beauty. It was mounted upon a little riſing hill, which made it ſhew to the City as the head to the body, both for ornament and command. It was not only the head of the City, but of the whole kingdom at that time, for in it ſat her Majeſty with her great Councel to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine concerning thoſe things which the neceſſity of their affairs made them to reſolve upon. Having viewed the external part of it, <hi>Araterus</hi> ſomewhat boldly for a ſtranger, aſcended a pair of ſtaires which led us into divers ſtately Halls; paſſing many of them we at laſt had loſt our ſelves, and knew not which way to return, at laſt trying every turning and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, we deſcended a pair of ſtaires, which brought us into a very large garden, in which were near an hundred Partizans. At the farther end of this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den was the Councel Chamber; in which the Queen and her Council
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:51633:128"/> then was, theſe Partizens being their common guard. Ignorance often cauſes boldneſs, for not knowing the cuſtome of the Countrey we entred the garden, which it ſeems was preſent death for any to do, whilſt the Council ſat, without the Certificate of the High-Prieſt, to ſhew their urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
                  <p>The Partizans preſently flocking about us, asked us for our Certificates, but our looks demonſtring to them that we were ignorant of what they meant, they ſtreight-way cryed out Traitors, and Spies, and collimating their Javelins at us, began to make us know into what error we had run. <hi>Araterus</hi> would fain have had them underſtand that ignorance an I fortune had brought him ro that place, but their noiſe and eagerneſs of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deprive us of our lives, took away the audition of his words, and made him ſee that if his ſword could not prove more effecacious th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We both drew for our defence, and did what ever could be expected from men hemmed in on every ſide with death-threatning weapons. We had both received many wounds, but for every wound <hi>Araterus</hi> gave a death: and for every drop of blood, he ſhed whole pools of theirs, and did things through deſperateneſs, that were ever after eſteemed Miracles. Valour muſt have at laſt given place to number, and life to death, if we had not been immediatly reſcued. The noiſe, that proceeded from this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter was heard amongſt the Councel, which at the firſt approach im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued them all with fears of treachery and complottings. All deſired to know the cauſe of what they heard, but every one was affraid to leave his ſeat, leaſt at their firſt peeping forth of doers they ſhould meet with the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of death, many of them knowing what belonged to a gown, but very little to a ſword; they could order, but not act. At laſt <hi>Peomontile</hi> uncle to the Queen, and one in whom <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> made a pleaſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, left his ſeat, and entring the garden, found us both at the laſt exigent. When he ſaw the inequality of our fight, although he knew they might juſtly put us to death for entring that place, yet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to leave us. His authority made them re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He beheld what <hi>Araterus</hi> had done with a countenance that betrayed his aſtoniſhment, at laſt demanding our deſign in entring the place contrary to the cuſtome and Law of the Countrey, <hi>Araterus</hi> told him by what accident he was conducted to the place, his ignorance of their cuſtomes, and his being a ſtranger in the place, which was eaſily ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by our faces which carried more hair then twenty of thoſe Eaſtern peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (the Sun contracting the pores of the body, and hindring the excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thoſe pilous excrements) with our not attaining to the perfect pronunciation of their language. <hi>Peomontile</hi> told him, it was requiſit, if he deſired his life, that he caſt by his weapons, and yield himſelf, and that before they aroſe, they would ſend for him, to give an account of this action to the Queen, and that if he could prove his integrity as he ſaid, or that it was done through ignorance without any deſign, he made no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but that he ſhould gain his pardon, but if otherwiſe that he were guilty of any deſign he was to expect what the Laws and Juſtice of the land in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. <hi>Araterus</hi> ſlung by his ſword, and offered his hands to be bound, I doing the like, we were carried into a room cloſe by the Councel, where we expected their leaſure. <hi>Peomontile</hi> returning gave them a brief account of what he had done, deſiring we might be brought before them before they broke up, to anſwer what we had done. Every one reſetling thoſe diſturbances fear had exſuſcitated in their breaſts, they proceeded upon thoſe weighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates on which they entred before this diſturbance. And becauſe that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Araterus</hi> was made acquainted with the reſult of the Council, and of

                  <p>The approaching Wars had neceſſitated the Queen to call her Councel; conſiſting of the chiefeſt of the kingdome, and thoſe whom experience had made prudent, and knowing, that nothing might be undertaken without the conſent of the whole, or at leaſt Major part. But how often is it! that Councels are called, out of meer formality and cuſtome, not to council, but to confirm the reſolutions of their Princes. Private paſſion and intereſt (eſpecially in women) is very dangerous, for being ſetled in an inflexible b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eaſt, although the moſt prudent Council is given, if it contradict their humours, it muſt cede to their follies. <hi>I</hi> ſpeake not this of <hi>Amarillis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her reſolutions had a good effect, and ſo all faults were ſmothered in the end, but in this regard it reaches her. She, as moſt Princes do, had firſt conſulted with her own thoughts, or with her neareſt favourites, who moſt commonly apply their verdicts to the inclinations and humours of the Prince, and out of that had framed her reſolutions and private decrees. She then convocated her Councel, to which ſhe came, not with a heart ſuſceptible of impreſſions, or with reſolutions to follow their dictates if they contradicted hers, but with deſire and paſſion to have them confirm (and conform to) her deſires. I will not ſay but that the Queens reſolutions were reaſonable, and it may be better than the opinion of her Councel, <hi>I</hi> will not ſay but that ſhe might be as clear-ſighted as they, or that they might not be byaſſed by private intereſt as well as ſhe. But after ſhe had told them the occaſion of their Convocation, and had made known how that ſhe would not undertake any thing without their Council and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, with applauding their wiſdomes, and tryed experience, the queſtion was propoſed amongſt them. Whether it were better to reſiſt the Prince of <hi>Sinana,</hi> or the Queen to yield to the marriage he deſired? This was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſcann'd and debated for many dayes, but that day on which we arrived there, was to put a period to it. The Queen was utterly againſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Prince of <hi>Sinana,</hi> but ſhe found her Council divided, and the major part againſt her. But indeed thoſe that oppoſed her, were many of them ſuſpected of bribery, having been too much acquainted with that Prince, others ſpake out of a ſpirit of fear and puſillanimity, and others by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed by their own intereſts, their Eſtates lying in the way, and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ruin of wars: ſo that the major part was againſt the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Queen, but the melior part was for her, amongſt the reſt was her uncle <hi>Peomontile</hi> with ſome of the graveſt, and moſt eſteemed heads. The reaſons of the adverſe part in brief were theſe. They firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiated themſelves upon the felicity of peace and tranquillity, ſhewing how happily they had lived for ſo many years, not being diſturbed by wars, they illuſtrated this by ſhewing at large the incommodities of War, which were the ſpending their Treaſure, their goods, their houſes, the loſs of her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the impoveriſhing their land, bringing death, ſcarcity and famine, the ſtopping of Trade and Manufacture, ſpoiling of Cities, ſacking of Townes, demoliſhing of houſes and Caſtles, and finally bringing all to ruin and confuſion: Then paſſing to particulars, they exhibited what manner of Prince they had to deal with, his patience, the number of his Armies, his Weapons, Proweſs, and every thing that might make him formidable. Then they ſhewed, that though they were numerous in people, yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſtomed in War, but having injoyed a long tranquillity, they would be ignorant in their weapons, and not able to withſtand them. That all this trouble, dan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er, loſs and deſtruction might eaſily be prevented by the marriage of the Queen, that it was not diſhonourable for her, he being the greateſt Potentate on the earth, but that it would be for her greater glory,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:51633:129"/> and her kingdome and peoples ſafety. The Queen ſeeing moſt of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil adhered to this, and fearing that her party would not have been able to have withſtood their reaſons, ſhewed that ſhe was a woman, for being ſtimulated with their preſſing her to marry the Prince, ſhe ſtood up, and not being able to ſmother her diſcontent, told them, that for her part ſhe had been alwayes willing to give her people content, though it were againſt her private inclinations, but in this ſhe was not able to yield to them. That ſhe hoped they would not force her to marry one whom by no means ſhe could affect. That if they feared theſe wars that ſo much threatned them, and that if they were perſwaded they would be the ruin of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and people, ſeeing they were weary of her government, ſhe would rather reſign up the intereſt ſhe had to the Crown, and retire her ſelf to a private life, whereby ſhe ſhould both ſatisfie her ſelf, and not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd to marry a Prince contrary to her inclinations, and take away all occaſions of War from them, in leaving the Government and Kingdome for their ſakes.</p>
                  <p>This ſpeech of the Queen troubled the adverſe party extreamly, but the other party having reaſons enough on their ſide told them by the mouth of <hi>Peomon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi> That they were very ſenſible o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the commodities and felicities of Peace, and of the happineſs they had enjoyed under it, and alſo that they were not ignorant of all thoſe diſcommodities, ruinations and ſubverſions that are incident to War. That they ſhould conſider that Peace was maintained by War, and that War was the mother of peace. That there was no War more juſt, than that which was to maintain their liberty: that the liberty of their Queen, was the liberty of themſelves; and that her captivity would prove their deſtruction. That although War was terrible, yet not being to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the end would be pleaſing. That they were not altogether to conſider the potency of their enemy, but to expect the adjuvation of the gods, who conſider the juſtneſs of the cauſe, and who effect great things by weak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. That for that end, and no other, but to defend themſelves, were they furniſhed with weapons; and if that any made uſe of them to offend their Neighbour wrongfully and unjuſty, that for the moſt part they fell by them, notwithſtanding their potence and greatneſs. That the war was unjuſt, is manifeſt, they but defended themſelves from the violence of a ſuperbous enemy, who it may be made the marriage of the Queen but a pretence to uſurp their Crown. That although the ſoldiers being unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to their weapons, they hoped the example of their Leaders, and the witneſs of their cauſe would infuſe ſuch animoſity into them, that they ſhould have no need to complain of their defects. That they ſhould very willingly hearken to them, (having the ſame lives, liberties and eſtates as they to be hazarded in the wars) could they propoſe any way, (with ſafety to their honours, and without detriment to the kingdome) to divert the approaching ſtorm, and to ſtop the effuſion of blood by the Wars. That what they already had propoſed was a cure far more dangerous than the wound, and from which they could expect no other than their utter and inevitable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. That 'twas the pooreſt of Polices to avoid a War by ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a peace, which although it might be honourable for the Queen, would prove very unhappy fot the Kingdome. That both reaſon and example might teach them, that an Heir and Heireſſe of a Kingdom made no happy conjunction for their people, the one being neceſſitated to obey the Laws and Rules of the other, and of a free ſtate and kingdome, to become a Province and ſubjected. That if their Queen maried the Prince of <hi>Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> 'twould bring them into more hazard and danger than the wars could effect, that they muſt expect to have their Kingdome tranſlated into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, ſubjugated to ſtrangers, ruled by Vice-roys allied to the Prince, that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:51633:129"/> they muſt be ſubject to their Lawes, obſerve their Ceremonies, and looſe both name and nature in that of <hi>Sinana.</hi> That they could not expect any help from the gracious influence of the Queen, ſhe being in another Countrey, ignorant of their miſeries, and it may be, if knowing them, may not have power to help them. That it may be, the Prince of <hi>Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> having through this pretence ſufficiently ſtrengthned their kingdome for his beſt advantage, and ſufficiently ſubjugated them, may then expoſe their Queen to ſcorn and ignominy, they not believing he could love her, whoſe ſubjects he ſeeks to invade unjuſty, and to gain her forceably. Laſtly, That it were better for the Queen to marry any younger Prince whom ſhe might inveſt with her Crown, or elſe as they have done heretofore to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the dangers that enſue exotick mariages, marie one of her Subjects, which is nothing diſhonourable, being maintained by frequent examples, and ſo their Lawes will not be changed, their rites altered, nor their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes ſubverted, but their kingdome would continue in its priſtine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, floriſhing and happy. And that (to conclude) if they were not able to ſee the percipice of that marriage, with the Tyranny, bondage and ſlavery they are like to undergo by it, but perſiſted ſtill in their opinions, for their part they had done their duties in diſcharging their conſciences, and that knowing the affection of the people to the Queen, they were reſolved to live and die in her defence, and to run the common hazard of the kingdome: That if there were any there that would not, they might ſit ſtill and ſhew their diſaffection to the common good, whilſt they roſe to proffer their ſervice to their Queen and Countrey. With that <hi>Peomontile</hi> with all that party ariſing up, offer'd their ſervice to the Queen, which the others ſeeing, did the like, ſome through fear imagining ſome deſign in <hi>Peomontile</hi>'s behaviour, and others convinced by the reaſons they had heard. Thus the Council ended to the great ſatisfaction of the Queen, who it ſeems had reſolved to have run any hazard, rather then to have married the Prince of <hi>Sinana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Council being ready to break up, <hi>Peomontile</hi> deſired the Queen that we might be brought before them. Preſently we were had in by an officer that attended them. The room where they ſat, was more ſtately than any we had ſeen, but the gravity and order of the Senators, cauſed a kind of reverence and awe in the beholders. But the place was more illuminated, by the beauty and Majeſty of the Queen, which if the one rendered the place awefull, the other rendered his ſacred and adoreable. Beauty was hemmed in with Majeſty, and both the one and the other was incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, there being a Kinde of pleaſing ſeverity mixed in every act and geſture. In all thoſe peregrinations which <hi>I</hi> have for ſo many years undergone, I could never meet till this hour any beauty that could furpaſs, or equalize that which our eyes then beheld. But now indeed I muſt confeſs, my eyes beheld in this ſequeſtred grote thoſe beauties that eclipſe the ſplendor and pulcritude of that Eaſtern Star, and make me juſtly paſs by thoſe praiſes I had intended for her. Indeed both hers and all the worlds muſt cede to thoſe which now illuminate and glorifie your Grote.</p>
                  <p>This raiſed the tincture in the faces of the two Princeſſes, but being loth to diſturbe him in his diſcourſe, they permited ſilence to preſide ore their lips, and heard him continue thus. Aſſoon as we were entred, I caſt my eyes upon <hi>Araterus,</hi> and found that the beams of beauty and Majeſty had dazled his eyes and underſtanding. Being ſurprized with an object ſo raviſhing, he was amazed, and ſtood in the poſture of a Criminal. His eyes fixed upon the Queen, loſt themſelves in their intuition. His colour viciſſively changing, would have made the Spectators believe that he had been
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:51633:130"/> guilty of ſome ill intent, or that 'twas through fear and puſillanimity. He was the Queens priſoner, and before he went out of the place, he was more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo: For Love, as if he had ment to make a kind of Triumph in his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation, ſat inthron'd and inviron'd with all kind of advantages in that place. He ſtood a long time receiving thoſe darts that were continually ejaculated from the two luminous orbs of <hi>Amarillis,</hi> by that god who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth his dominion from the riſing of glorious <hi>Titan,</hi> to his immergency in the occidental waves, and who leaveth no part of the world free from his ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and tyranny. The Queen with no leſs fixed looks beheld <hi>Araterus,</hi> and it ſeems receiving reciprocal wounds from his looks and actions. <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi> as you know, was every way handſome, and in his face eſpecially, no deſpicable Throne for love. They were mute all this while, though their eyes ſpake an occult and magical language, having indeed ſometimes as great a power in love, as the moſt rhetorical and pleaſing tongues. At laſt <hi>Araterus</hi> recollecting himſelf, diſſipated that kind of amazedneſs, and conforming his body to his ſpeech, endeavoured with all the ski<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I am a ſtranger, Madam! as you may well perceive by divers marks that make me different from your Nation: And I was (as I may ſay) of another world, but being upon the moſt caprichious element, hurried on by the blaſts of fortune and of ſtorms, I was caſt on unknown Countryes, through which I have travelled with danger and peril enough, and at laſt being ſhipwrack'd on your Coaſts, I found an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by one of your Subjects, as generous as good, till I had gain'd this ſmattering in your language which you hear; who telling me the occaſion of your approaching Wars, he inſpired me with a deſire to ſerve you. For this end I left his habitation, with an intent to make you a proffer of my ſervice. Having devoted my ſelf to you, and entring the City this day, being utterly ignorant of your Cuſtomes and Lawes, and without any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign than of viewing the ornaments of your Pallace, I have through my bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ignorance incurred a danger, and I fear your Majeſties diſpleaſure. But I hope my ignorance will exuſcitate your clemency, and gain a pardon for him who hath already devoted his life to your ſervice, and who deſires no longer to live, than that his life may be ſerviceable to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
                  <p>He had a very favourable audience of the Queen, there being ſomething of charms both in his tongue and face: we were cauſed to withdraw, and after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while being brought in again, <hi>Peomontile</hi> told <hi>Araterus,</hi> that the Queen according to her wonted Clemency, and natural inclinations of mercy to ſtrangers, and to thoſe who were not wilfull Criminals; had pardoned him his temerity, and did accept of the ſervice he profer'd. That he ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her after the Council was riſen, to receive thoſe teſtimonies of her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality which ſhe was accuſtomed to give to thoſe, that ſo freely deſired to ſerve her. <hi>Araterus</hi> bowing to the ground, with a very good grace gave her thanks for her favours, which purchaſed him the kiſſing of her Robe, a favour but ſeldome ſhewed, they accounting all that belong to their Princes ſacred. Being departed, we went to our lodging, having our liberty by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Queen. I perceived a great deal of trouble in the face of <hi>Araterus,</hi> and diſcompoſure in his looks. Our long converſation and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual miſeries had made me very bold with him, ſo that I asked him the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:51633:130"/> of it. He was unwilling at firſt to tell me, accounting the cauſe ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but at laſt he told me it proceeded from the beauty and ſplendor which accompanied the Queen, and that he had endeavoured to allay thoſe emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, knowing the diſproportion between them, but the more that he eſſaied it, the more violent they grew. He confeſſed he had imbib'd that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſturb his repoſe, and which began to make him feel the inquietudes of thoſe that love. But accounting his moſt inſulſe and vain, he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with himſelf for entertaining thoſe motions, though he knew not how to ſhun them. I encouraged him in them, and told him, that 'twas ſo decreed by heaven, and that he was not to doubt it, ſeeing that part of the prediction of <hi>Baercellizeg</hi> was fulfilled in our being brought to the utmoſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Eaſt: That he had undergone the worſt of the prediction, and that he ſhould not fear to ſee the beſt part alſo fulfilled.

                  <p>The Queen (as we afterwards underſtood) having felt thoſe violencies and emotions which were raiſed in her breaſt at the ſight of her priſoner, and not being accuſtomed to the like, wondred from whence they ſhould proceed. She could not imagine at firſt, that it ſhould be Love, having to vigorouſly withſtood all the Charms of her Adorers, being the greateſt and chiefeſt Princeſs in the Eaſt. Endeavouring to divert thoſe cogitations that this new diſturbance raiſed, ſhe employed her ſelf in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mergent affairs, which the neceſſity of ſtate introduced. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raterus</hi> preſenting himſelf ſometimes before the eye of her mind, put her in remembrance of her promiſe, and cauſed her to command <hi>Peomon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> to ſee for <hi>Araterus,</hi> whom he found walking in the Anti-chamber re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitating on the beauties and Majeſties of <hi>Amarillis.</hi> After their firſt civilities <hi>Araterus</hi> followed <hi>Peomontile,</hi> thorow many Chambers into a fair Gallery, ſupported with Pillars of Jaſper, and the Corniſhes of Ebony ſet with Emralds and Saphirs. At the upper end ſat the Queen in a ſeat of lvory inlaid with Gold and precious ſtones of the Orient, her elbow reſting on the frame of her ſeat, and her Crimſon coloured cheeks kiſſing the lilies of her hands. She was in a deep muſing, but at the firſt ſight of <hi>Araterus</hi> ſhe ſtarted into a compoſure, and with a generous violence gave him a reception free from any open perturbation. <hi>Araterus</hi> after his firſt reverence, and permiſſion to kiſs the lower end of her veſtment, with the beſt of his language told her the immemſity of his deſire to ſerve her. This he performed with ſo pleaſing and taking a language, that not only the Queen, but all thoſe that ſtood about her, confeſt he was the moſt accompliſhed ſtranger that ever they had ſeen. The Queen conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with him, asked him many queſtions concerning his Countrey, and Nation, and concerning his birth and quality, with divers other things of our Manners, Cuſtomes and Lawes, to all which <hi>Araterus</hi> anſwered ſo promptly, ſo gracefully, and with ſuch ſatisfaction and pleaſure, that they found no weariſomneſs in a diſcourſe that laſted two hours, nor had been ſcarcely broken off then, but that the Sun reviſiting the weſtern parts of the world, began to leave the Orient deſtitute of his light and ſplendor. Both being well ſatisfied with each others wit and behaviour, <hi>Araterus</hi> at the Queens command retired, ſhe telling him that he ſhould the next day at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her in the Camp, where there being a general Muſter, ſhe would
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:51633:131"/> aſſign him a place to ſerve her in, promiſing that he ſhould not find her ingrateful to his ſervices. <hi>Araterus</hi> returned more fired than before, and ſo full of ardencies, that he vowed to ſerve her all the reſt of his dayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever thinking of returning to his own Countrey again. He thought her worthy of all honour and eſteem, and believed that the ſacrificeing of a thouſand lives in her defence, would not be a victim ſufficient to obtain the leaſt favour or grace. Whilſt <hi>Araterus</hi> ſpent the night in thoſe unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual agitations Love and Deſire cauſed, the Queen with no leſs diſturbance, paſt it over in the ſilent meditation of him. She ſought oftentimes (as ſhe told <hi>Araterus</hi> afterwards) to interdict his appearance in her memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to baniſh him into oblivion, but he preſſed on ſo heard, and appear'd arm'd with ſo many charms, that 'twas impoſſible for her, not to give him admiſſion into her thoughts. This night being paſſed over with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little ſleep on the part of <hi>Araterus,</hi> he appeared on the morrow at the place appointed, which was in a large plaine on the North-ſide of the City. In that place was met the whole ſtrength of the kingdome, in ſo gallant an equipage, that we accounted it the greateſt rarity we had yet ſeen. I doubt what I ſhall tell you will be ſcarce credited, when you ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Armies of the Eaſt of <hi>Aſia</hi> with thoſe of this part, or of <hi>Europe,</hi> not conſidering the vaſtneſs of their Countryes, and populoſity of them, the land not being ſufficient to contain them, is fain to borrow habitations for millions on his neighbour element. The plaine (which was only cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with trees towards the City) was of an extent of many Leagues, on which was ſpread milions of Tents, made of a thin kind of ſtuff imbued with divers colours, being branched forth into rare works and compartments. On the top of the <hi>Chieftaine</hi>'s, or (according to their language) <hi>Birebaſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi>'s Tent of each Province or Shire, hung the <hi>Inſigna</hi> of each Province, to which all of that Province were to repaire. Of theſe there were ſeven Tents that carried <hi>Inſigna's,</hi> ſix of the Provinces, and one of the Cities, which had an <hi>Inſigna</hi> by it ſelf, beſides the royal ſtandards of the Queens which appeared more ſuperb then all. Theſe head or capital Tents ſtood an equal diſtance each from another, and although it were on a plaine, on which the Horizon might be ſeen a vaſt way, the lines lying plane and level, yet the tops of the one could hardly be perceived from another. They were placed four ſquare, makeing a ſmall intrenchment for many Leagues about each Tent, leaving large ſpaces betwixt for the exerciſe of armes. Within theſe entrenchments were the Tents of all the under Captaines, with their Companies, which conſiſted moſt commonly of five thouſand. The tent with the <hi>inſigna</hi> of <hi>Sinda</hi> was pitched next to the City, all their Companies being ſtretched along by the wall of the City, the other ſtanding like a large Quadrangle encloſed the royal Tent of the Queens, which at a diſtance exhibited it ſelf like a large Caſtle, in which was vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of rooms and conveniencies, and yet made with ſuch art, that in ſix hours it could be either ſet up or taken down, its greatneſs nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring its portage, there being Elephants for that purpoſe. The Tents ſet forth with variety of paintings, and imbelliſhed with ſtreamers, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themſelves very pleaſing Objects to the ſight, but the innumerable companies of men and arms amazed us, and made us believe that 'twas impoſſible they ſhould be overcome, yet they confeſt they expected their enemies with far greater force. Whilſt we were amazed at what we had ſeen, we ſaw another thing which would at firſt ſight ſeem a great wonder amongſt us. 'Twas a Charriot which comming on the left hand of us, ran a great pace over the plane without the drawing of any living animal. You would have thought it had been inchanted, or that your eyes had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, we indeed counted it ſtrange at firſt, but having often ſeen them
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:51633:131"/> uſed 'twas no wonder to us. The firſt inventor of them was a <hi>Sinanan,</hi> who intended to make the land navigable, that they might ſail as well upon the land as the ſea. They were made in form of a boat, with four wheels, with ſprings and engines that rendred it flexible every way. The guidance was not without art, and was managed by one, who as the Pilot in the ſhip, kept it direct before the wind: In the middle it had ſmall Maſts, on which were ſpread the ſails, that being ſwoln with the wind, moved the Charriot a great ſwiftneſs over the plane. This Chariot which we ſaw, we ſoon knew by the richneſs and the <hi>inſigna</hi> to be the Queens, which took the way to her royal Tent, being followed by all her Court. <hi>Araterus</hi> rode not far from the Charriot, all the while contemplating of thoſe things which are memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to Lovers. Afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſhe had entred her Tent which illuſtrated the whole plane, and a while repoſed her ſelf, <hi>Araterus</hi> was had in by <hi>Peomontile.</hi> The Queen was ſeated in a kind of Throne, advanced by ſome ſteps in a ſpacious room, where ſhe expected all the Chieftains of the Provinces to render up their Muſter rolls, that ſhe might know the number of the men and arms. I will remit the nominating of their Captains or Provinces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only names, harſh and barbarous in your ears, and only give you an account of their number and order, that I may not render you weary with my prolixity. <hi>Peomontile</hi> being the Chieftain of the City had the firſt place of preſenting the number of men under his charge, which were an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thouſand, with five thouſand Elephants with Caſtls, divided into troops, and ſubdivided into Companies, every Captain of a Company having under him five thouſand, and of a Troop fifty thouſand. The other Chieftains in order preſented the Queen likewiſe with their rolls after they had been admitted to kiſs the end of her robe, the firſt Province brought two hundred and eight thouſand men, well armed and appointed with a thouſand Elephants, the ſecond as many, the third ten thouſand more, the fourth brought five hundred thouſand, the fifth and ſixth two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men and five thouſand Elephants, a beaſt ordinarily uſed in wars in thoſe Countryes, ſo that all their Army conſiſted of ſixteen hundred and eighty four thouſand men, and fifteen thouſand Elephants. The Queen haveing the abſolute diſpoſe of the Militia, gave order to the Captaines concerning their pay and rewards. In their Wars the Chieftain of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty uſes evermore to be <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> and therefore it was conferred on <hi>Peomontile,</hi> one indeed capable of the place, the other Chieftains having the leading of thoſe of their ſeveral Provinces. <hi>Araterus</hi> not being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, was made Captain of her life-gard, a place of honour and truſt. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion indeed alwayes blinds reaſon, and makes the moſt prudent erre in his judgement: The Queen, one of the wiſeſt of the Eaſt, having felt the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent agitations of a growing paſſion, loſt her judgement, and followed its dictates. In all other things ſhe was of a ſolid judgement, and could diſtinguiſh right by the light of reaſon, but in thoſe that touched her private intereſts, where ſhe could not keep out paſſion. She knew that ſhe had err'd, and yet ſhe could not but erre, <hi>Araterus</hi> was already one, more to her than another, and ſhe began to ſhew her partiality in this action. She could not reſolve to love him, and yet ſhe could not hate him, or hazard him: ſhe loved to ſee him, and therefore ſhe ordained that place to keep him nigh her, and to oblige him to her. It may be ſhe did not ſee that this was the dictates of her paſſion, but rather thought it thoſe of her good Genius or titular an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, but ſhe could not be ignorant, but that this action would be ſtrangely reſented, and that it would beget <hi>Araterus</hi> more envy and enemies than love or friends. Such ſudden favourites are alwayes envied, and ſometimes ruined, eſpecially being ſtrangers. <hi>Araterus</hi> indeed believing the danger to be greater than the honour, civilly refuſed, and beg'd her not to make him ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbly ſuch
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:51633:132"/> immenſe favours, but to reward him according to his merits, but ſhe preſſing it he could not with ſafety refuſe it, his paſſion pleading for ſo advantagious a place.</p>
                  <p>He being ſetled in the place according to the orders of the Queen, it was preſently known throughout the Camp, and very odly reſented, but the authority of the Queen made them but whiſper, not ſpeak aloud by their ill reſentment of it. Their wondring and muttering did but very privately arrive at their ears; ſo that ſhe took no notice of it, hoping it would ſoon be huſht, and the vertue of <hi>Araterus</hi> would quiet their ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Things remained awhile in this ſtate, <hi>Araterus</hi> being very ſenſible of the favours of the Queen, and his place obliging him to it, he often viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and had conference with her. Amongſt ſuch a numerous Army 'twas a wonder to ſee ſo much order and quietude, the City ſhewed no ſign of all theſe preparations, or of War, but by a little more vigilancy: The ſoldiers were all kept without the City, that they might not annoy it. The Queen had word brought her by her Curriors, that the army of her enemies was advancing towards the frontiers, and that they ſeemed to take the way of <hi>Cherlozth,</hi> and that beſides this Army there appeared a fleet comming from the lower Provinces of <hi>Sinana,</hi> which ſeem'd to cover the whole gulf of <hi>Bengan.</hi> The Queen calling her Council, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving adviſed together, they gave order to one of the <hi>Borebaſſae</hi>'s to advance with half the Army towards the place where they expected the enemies to enter. And the reſt to enter the City under <hi>Peomontile</hi> to ſecure it, half of them entring into the ſhips, under the <hi>Alquebuzque,</hi> or Admiral of the ſea. Every thing was put into a poſture of defence, moſt expecting their enemies with impatiencies. The Queen experimenting the wiſdome and knowledge of <hi>Araterus,</hi> let never a day paſs without diſcourſing with him, concerning one thing or other, and finding him ſo rational in all his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, ſhe began to make him oraculous. Being in diſcourſe with her concerning the War, and having a longng deſire to be bickering with the enemy, that he might exhibite his valour, believing that the only way to render himſelf gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in her eyes, and knowing that this place would oblige him not to leave the Queen, nor to be preſent in the Encounter, he intreated her to reſtore her former captain into her favour, and to permit him to ſerve her under <hi>Peomontile,</hi> or if ſhe dared to repoſe her truſt in his skill or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, to grant him the defence of the haven, where he might be more ſerviceable to her Majeſty, than in that place ſhe had honoured him with. She was ſomewhat difficult in granting this, both in conſideration of his danger, and of her peoples murmuring. But he preſſing her two or three times, ſhe was fain to let love overcome reaſon, and to grant what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. He was no ſooner ſetled in that place by the Queens order with a hundred thouſand men under his charge, but the reſt of the Captains and Soldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being highly diſpleaſed, loſt their wonted reſpect, and ceaſed not openly to deprave this action of the Queens, ſome believing him a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They proceeded ſo far in their diſreſpect, and ſpake ſo loud, that they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt mutined, had not <hi>Peomontile</hi> ſatisfied them by promiſing to make the Queen acquainted with their councel, care and fidelity. He preſently made the Queen acquainted with it, and told her ſhe might incur extream danger by their evil reſentments, and therefore adviſed her to recall him, and not provoke the Soldiers in this exigent. The Queen heard him, but being of a humour alwayes reſolute, would not alter what ſhe had done, but told him, that ſhe confided very much in <hi>Araterus,</hi> knowing him to be valiant by what he had done at his firſt coming thither, and that his diſcourſe exhibited

That 'twas true ſhe had entruſted him with the Key or ſtrength of her Kingdome, but that it would rather encourage him to trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery than ſtop him to ſuſpect him, now, That it was not ſafe to enrage a man from whom ſhe expected much, to degrade him now: That if he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intentions to betray her, her generoſity and goodneſſe would oblige him to the contrary, That if he had any ſuch intentions he could not effect them, not having gained the affections of the ſouldiers, and ſhe knowing that her Captaines would not obey him farther then they might ſee that it tended to the ſafety of the Kingdome, and laſtly, That ſhe gave him leave to ſet a private guard about him to obſerve his actions, which if they tended not to the ſafety of the Kingdom, ſhe remitted him into his hands, to do what he pleaſed with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Peomontile</hi> ſeeing the reſolutions of the Queen, &amp; not having any ſiniſter opinion of <hi>Araterus</hi> ſeem'd contented, and leaving the Queen with his authority, and perſwaſions, he at laſt pacified the ſouldiers, and begat a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion in many of <hi>Araterus:</hi> who hearing of theſe paſſages extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to rectifie their thoughts concerning him by his actions, which he effected ſoon after.</p>
                  <p>Every one expecting the enemies with much impatiency, prepared all things that were neceſſary for their defence. The City was every where fortified and well guarded, the ports all along the gulfe ſecured, the fine that came into the City chained up, with a kind of fort made of boates to defend it, and at the mouth lay their ſhips and boates ready prepared, moſt of all the bigger veſſels being armed with ſithes, &amp; hooks, and their prowes ſet with ſharpe Irons, to ſpoyle their tackle, and ſhips. There was nothing wanting that thoſe Kingdomes could afford, either for their own defence or to oftend their enemys. <hi>Araterus</hi> alſo animating his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to the defence of their Queen, their own lives and liberties, ſet them on fire with a longing to be fighting with their enemies, that they might te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the courage his words had inſpired into them. After ſome few dayes the fleet of the enemies was diſcovered from the ſummit of a high tower, which conſiſted of ſuch an innumerable company of veſſells that the ſea ſeemed to groan under their weight. The noiſe of their enemies inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as Clarons, Trumpets, Flutes and ſuch like, being heard, they were reanſwered from the fleet of the <hi>Sornaleans,</hi> with the like, and with ſhouts that exhibited they were nothing feared with their approach. Two dayes they lay in the gulfe within fight of the fleet without ſhewing the leaſt ſigne of engageing, the third, being favoured with a full winde, they came up towards ours; with ſuch a ſhout, that the fowle which flew over their heads through the clarification of the aire, fell as dead among their ſhips.

                  <p>This kind of weapon amazed us, having never before beheld the like, and made us in the midſt of that confuſion conſider its danger. The <hi>Sornaleans</hi> reanſwered their ſhot, with another of darts, and ſlings, which breaking their way thorow the ſmoake gave many of their enemies their deaths: Knowing that 'twas not for their ſafety to keep at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with them, they tacked about and gaining the wind came in upon them with a fury not to be depainted. Their prowes ruſhing one againſt
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:51633:133"/> another made a horrible craſh, and riving many in two, let in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domitable water into their bowels, valour was exhibited on both ſides, and ſtrength and fury reigned every where: but the <hi>Sinanans</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing galled our ſhips with their great ſhot between wind and water, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſunke to the bottome of the gulf.

                  <p>Blood and Death reigned every where, and this encounter laſted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny houres accompanyed with all the horror and ſlaughter that can be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the immagination. All the ſhips being intermingled one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother made a ſtrange confuſed noyſe made up of groans and ſhoutes. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raterus</hi> had beheld this naumachy with wonderfull impatiency, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports from the forte that defended the ſine, being ready at every ſhout and diſadvantage to leap into the ſea, but the remembrance of his charge kept him in the fort, and ty'd him to his duty till that he ſaw the <hi>Sorna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> looſe ſhips apace, and began to faint, being too much preſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by their numerous enemies. He was then no longer able to contain himſelf, but cauſing all the ſmall veſſels which lay within the rode to be got together he man'd them with thirty thouſand men, and leaving the reſt under command to ſecure the Key, he advanced towards the fleet, and with undaunted courage mauger all the endeavours of his enemies, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe borded their viceadmirall, and clearing the decks took her from a whole ſquadron of enemies. The reſt emboldened by this action, fought ſo ſtoutly that the diſadvantage perſpicuouſly appeared on our enemies ſide, having loſt all thoſe ſhips they had taken with many of their own. Night coming on, the ſleets ſeparated with a conſiderable loſſe on both ſides, ours indeed had loſt moſt veſſels, but they by far moſt men.</p>
                  <p>'Twas darke before they left them, and both caſt anchor within ſight of each other, makeing a ſhew of another battell the next morning. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raterus</hi> returned to the ſort highly commended by his followers for his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and courage. Love had directed the eyes of the Queen to obſerve his actions, which made her to ſend for him the ſame night, where ſhe gave him thoſe collaudations and <hi>Eulogiums</hi> which his modeſty would not have accepted, and which did but raiſe up the envie of others, though ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded all alike leſt any ſhould take notice of her partiality, ſhe alſo commanded her own Chirurgions to dreſſe thoſe wounds he had received which were a thruſt into the left hand, which he got in boarding the vice-admirall, and a ſhot thorow the ſame arme by one of their Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.</p>
                  <p>By this action <hi>Araterus</hi> gain'd the favour of many, by clearing thoſe ſuſpicions they had of him, and eſpecially amongſt the reſt <hi>Peomontile,</hi> who highly carreſſed, and eſteemed him. The next morning appearing, each ſide had light to view their loſſe; which was ſo conſiderable that they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no deſire of a ſecond encounter, before they had repaired their brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. In this poſture the <hi>Sinanans</hi> continued eight days, and being well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed with the courage of the <hi>Sornaleans</hi> they feared to hazard another bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by ſea. They ſaw that the ports were too well guarded for them to land, and notwithſtanding their great puiſſance they ſaw 'twas a matter of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility to endammage the City. Land they muſt, and therefore they
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:51633:133"/> endeavoured to effect it without our ſuſpition or knowledge; having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered all places that were any thing commodious, they pitched on an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure place which indeed was too weak to make any reſiſtance. In the night time as ſilently as might be they paſſed moſt of their men into half of their veſſells, leaving the other in the place with a command to ſpread wide that their departure might not be perceived by us. This was done ſo ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we had no notice of it, till by the firing of certain beakons, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that they were in danger &amp; preſently after the curriors brought word that they had landed their men in a bay where they were notable to reſiſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peomontile</hi> calling all the chief of the officers together (<hi>Araterus</hi> being among the reſt) deſired their counſells in this caſe. After many had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Araterus</hi> was of this opinion: That delay would be very prejudiciall to their affaires, that 'twas requiſite the whole fleet ſhould advance towards that of their enemies, when he was perſwaded 'twas left but poorly man'd and left on purpoſe but to amuſe them, that in the mean time <hi>Peomontile</hi> ſhould advance by land towards the place where the <hi>Sinanans</hi> were landed that they might not advantage themſelves too much, by the uſe of the country, and that they might appear before that they could order ſo great a body.

Having joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then with the ſleet they weighed anchor and made to that of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with full ſaile. They knowing their own weakneſſe did not dare to hazard a battle, but perceiving our intention gained the Point and ſled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. We could not fetch them up before they had entred the bay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their other ſhips. Believing it beſt to ſtay for the appearance of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omontile</hi> on the land we lay at the mouth of the bay wide of one another, the ſea favouring us with a happy tranquillity. <hi>Peomontile</hi> uſing all poſſible expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and being well accquainted with the ways, appeared at the backs of his enemies very unexpectedly, ſome few dayes after our arrivall. The enemy were encamped in a very diſadvantagious place, and where they could make very little uſe of their great Murtherers, which they had but newly unſhipped.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peomontile</hi> being very expert gained a hill which they had neglected to their great diſadvantage, not expecting them ſo ſoon, ſpreading his men he almoſt inviron'd them, moſt of theirs continuing on the ſhore, fearing an aſſault from our ſhips, which as it were beſieged them. The Queen having a daſire to be an eye-witneſſe of the actions of her ſouldiers and I believe eſpecially of <hi>Araterus,</hi> from whom love perſwaded her to expect ſome great action, left the City with a guard of ſive thouſand partizans, and drawn in her Royal Chariot, made of the faireſt Elephants tooth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with gold, the wheeles of Ebony, with bands and nails of ſilver, covered over with cloth of gold and tiſſue, drawn by two white <hi>Elephants</hi> the faireſt the Eaſt ever produced, crown'd with golden crownes, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſilk, in which was embroidered the arms of the Queen, which was the <hi>Sun</hi> Orient. In this equipage ſhe came to a rock on the left hand of the campe from whence ſhe could perceive both the armies and the navies, and diſtinguiſh thoſe ſhe knew from the reſt: preſently after her arrivall ſhe ſent a ſmall boat to <hi>Araterus,</hi> with an expreſſe that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to conſer with him.

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:51633:134"/> into counſell concerning their affairs, the concluſion whereof was, that they ſhould adventure a battail, having the advantage of the ground, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their enemies exceeded them in number, that at the ſame time they ſhould begin it both by ſea and land, at the firing of a beakon, which ſhould be aſſoon as the Sun appeared the next day, and that in the mean time they ſhould reſt and prepare their ſouldiers for it. This being concluded, they gave <hi>Araterus</hi> an Order to give the admiral for the execution of what they had concluded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Araterus</hi> being about to depart was met with by a damoſell from the Queen, who preſented him in the Queens name a crimſon ſcarf emboſt with the faireſt pearls that ever eye beheld, which made up the name of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marillis</hi> in great letters, the length of the ſcarf, at each end was her armes ſet with the emboſsment of diamonds, and fring'd with gold and long taſſels of Pearls. <hi>Araterus</hi> was amazed at the richneſſe and bravery of the ſcarfe, and receiving it with reſpect deſired her to tel the Queen that before the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row night, he hop'd to be a meanes to render her tryumphant over all her enemys, or to looſe his life in the action. That what ever he was able to performe ſhould not be attributed to himſelf, but accounted the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a power which inſpired him through the immenſity of her favours and goodneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Being returned to the ſhips he gave the Order of the general to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, who thereby knowing his intentions ſpent the reſt of the day in the preparation of his veſſels, and in incouraging his men to do bravely. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raterus</hi> being agitated by his love, expected the next day with impatiency, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to ſignalize his actions, and make him ſelfe worthy of the high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Queen, by perpetrating to the utmoſt whatſomever the immenſe force of his love, and innate valour could carry him to. The next day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſome houres after <hi>Araterus</hi> had expected it with waking eyes, after he had ſaluted the Gods with his prayers, and eſpecially the deity of Love, he cauſed me to help him on with his armes, which he had cauſed to be made in that country: They were made of the beſt ſteel, the umbraces and bucklings of plates of ſilver; his cuirace ſet out with great boſſes of gold and pearl, and his caske, of a mixt mettal, was ſhaded with a plume of Oſtrich feathers tinctur'd with oſtrum, which imbued it with a purple, upon his left arme he tyed the ſignall of the Queens favour which ſhe ſent him the night before. In this manner he awaited the ſignall: which was given at the time appointed. The ſhips preſently moved towards their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who expecting the encounter receiv'd them with reſolution and valour. Whilſt the two fleets were performing all that could be expected from their force and puiſſance, filling every place with horror, death, blood, and confuſion; <hi>Peomontile</hi> having divided the army into four battalions, moved deliberately and in good order towards the <hi>Sinanans.</hi> The generall of the <hi>Sinanans</hi> being both valiant and Politick, and ſeconded by the Prince himſelfe who led the Van of the cavalrie, a Prince valiant enough, but withall furious and temerary, had notice of our intentions to fight and therefore was fully prepared for us. He ſaw the diſadvantages that they had in the ground, but being ſupernumerary in men, he hoped to overwhelme ours: Beſides they had the advantage in weapons; half of their men carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe hand-murtherers. He had divided his army into 6. battalions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very battallion equalling ours, if not exceeding. It will be needleſſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe this battle to you, though it were one of the bloodieſt, and greateſt, that ever was fought in the Eaſt, both for that your ſelf have been in many, and therefore know the heat and <hi>Mars-</hi>full <hi>Enthuſiaſme</hi> that then agitates generous, and couragious ſpirits, and that I may not terrifie theſe Ladies with the relation of nothing but horror, blood and death.

The Queen with the moſt conſiderable Ladies in the Kingdome was mounted on the utmoſt ſummit of the Rock, that they might the better aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault Heaven with their prayers, and that they might behold a battel that made the ſtrongeſt amongſt them yield themſelves to fears and fainting.

Her eyes were inſeparable to the navie, and you may believe that 'twas for <hi>Araterus</hi>'s ſake that ſhe was ſo partiall as to regard that battle on the ſea, more than that on the Land. Indeed her eyes ſought for <hi>Araterus,</hi> 'twas a very eaſie matter for love to make her finde him, he rendering himſelf ſo ſignall and remarkable. She ſaw him do wonders and miracles, and as if victory ſtill attended him ſhe could not withdraw her eyes from obſerving him, and indeed his actions were ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe that they chain'd her eyes to him with a kind of pleaſinng charm and inchantment.</p>
                  <p>They followed him thorow the thickeſt preſſe, and accompanyed him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt blood, wounds, &amp; arms. I need not tell you that every time ſhe ſaw him in danger, ſhe was ſtruck with fear of looſing him which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made her change colour a thouſand times, and which would have been obſerved by others, had not ſo generall a congreſſion attracted all their eyes with an intenſity on their actions. <hi>Araterus</hi> after he had brought terrour, wounds, and death to all that oppoſed him; and begat an admiration in all that beheld, with an undaunted courage being grapled with the admiral entred his ſhip, and there giving death and mortall wounds to all that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him, made the reſt fly, whom he purſued into the hold, where finding a great deal of combuſtible matter he flung ſome of their black powder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt it, and after that ſome fire which he had got in the ſhip; This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently taking fire, ſet the ſhip into a light conſlagration which being drove with a gale of wind amongſt the reſt, caught hold of all that came a near it, and the ſhips lying ſo cloſe grapled together, took it with ſuch futy, and ſo immenſe a flame, that there needed then no other enemy to conteſt with. Our admirall cauſed as many ſhips as poſſibly could to be ſaved of ours, and turning their prows about got forth of the bay, and left thoſe flames the victory, which gained a very abſolute on over them, for their ſhips being ſo numerous, and conjoyned ſo thick one to another 'twas impoſſible to hinder the progreſſe of the flame, which running from one ſhip to another at laſt conſum'd the whole navy to aſhes, with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of their men: For ſome flying the fire, periſh'd in the water, and others thinking to eſcape drowning, got into the ſhips and were burnt.</p>
                  <p>Then it was that the flames, ſmoke, and conſuſion had obſcured <hi>Araterus</hi> from the eyes of the Queen, ſhe fear'd that ſhe had utterly loſt him, and that he had periſhed with thouſand others, this made her, as if the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory depended wholy on his life or death, to turn away her head from that fatal place with diſpairing eyes, as if the combuſtion of her enemies ſhips had been to her loſſe and detriment. And (if it be true as ſhe ſaid from whom <hi>I</hi> learn't this afterwards) ſhe could not abſtain from ſhedding ſome teares at the conceited loſſe of <hi>Araterus.</hi> But her eyes were ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clear'd, for ſhe had no ſooner caſt them on the midſt of the battell, but ſhe ſaw him victorious, and conquering, and doing his ordinary wonders, at the Head of her army. He but narrowly eſcaped the danger of being drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or burnt, but when he had ſet the ſhip on fire he gain'd a little boat

Then it was that fear, and griefe depainted it ſelfe moſt virely in the eyes and face of the Queen, Who not able to ſee him in that exigent fell into a ſowne, in the armes of her Ladies, who attributed it to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her immagination on theſe dreadfull, and dying objects. This made her looſe the ſight of the braveſt actions in the world, for he deſpairing of life, reſolved to ſacrifice as many as he could to love, his actions were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, and he ſoon made him a rampart of dead bodies, ſtill defending his life from the moſt daring, till the generall loth to looſe a man of ſuch importance reſcued him out of that danger, and mauger the oppoſition of the enemies mounted him on another horſe. Ours began to get the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when their laſt battails joyned with ſo great impetuoſity that it render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the victory doubtfull, and made them make uſe of the utmoſt of their courage and force to withſtand them.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> ſhall not lye if I ſay that the actions of <hi>Araterus</hi> diſpoſed the victory on our ſide, for they were ſo ſignal and daring that they both encouraged the <hi>Sornaleans,</hi> and made deſperate our adverſaries.

Then it was that victory having hung a long while in ſuſpence, came and ſetled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſtandards, for at that inſtant all thoſe of the Navey being landed, came on them with a freſh encounter in their flanks, and crying out <hi>victory, victory,</hi> did ſuch execution that it terrified them all, and ſeeing their ſhips burnt, their General ſlain, and their Prince wounded, they began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of victory, and to retreat diſorderly. The <hi>Sornaleans</hi> perceiving the fear of their enemies, renewed their courages, and crying out <hi>victory</hi> on every ſide, perſwaded their enemies that it was ſo, before they had it. At laſt they forgot their order, and ſled confuſedly, being ſlaughtered on every ſide by their enemies, who then ſlew more then they had done all the day before, and of ſo numerous an Army let very few eſcape the puniſhment of the ſword. <hi>Araterus</hi> being in the chaſe, took the Prince priſoner, and ſo ſaved his life from the enraged multitude, ſome few eſcaped to thoſe ſhips that the fire had left, and ſo recovered the ſea, the reſt eſcaping into woods, and ſuch places of ſhelter, ſaved their lives, and left the <hi>Sornaleans</hi> victorious and triumphant.</p>

Neither will it be much to the purpoſe to tell you the number of the wounded, or priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. <hi>Araterus</hi> ſinning himſelf wounded in two places in the arm, and in the face, retired to the Generals tent, and finding that his wound in his head was very dangerous, he left him, and went into another hard by ſet up by the Generals order, where he had his wounds dreſſed by <hi>Peomontiles</hi> own Surgions. The Queen having ſeen the end of the battle, ſaluted the gods with her prayers, and gave them innumberable thanks for the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had ſent her, in the perſon of the valiant ſtranger.

They were ſcarcely lodg'd in <hi>Sinda</hi> before the Queen received word by the Poſts, that her other Army in the Frontiers had received a great overthrow, through the unskilfulneſs of their Leader, and that the enemies troops ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceing apace, came accompanied with victory, fire and ſword. This news put a damp upon the Generals rejoyceing, and made them ſee their danger was not over. The Queen ſending for <hi>Peomontile</hi> and <hi>Araterus,</hi> told them this newes, and withal, that ſhe was not to expect victory from any other hands than from the ſage <hi>Peomontile,</hi> and the valiant <hi>Araterus:</hi> that it was for their glory that her army had received the overthrow, the gods having ordained, that none beſides themſelves ſhould contribute any thing to hers, and her kingdomes happineſs: And that it was them alone that ſhe ought juſtly to ſtile her Protectors and deliverers. Theſe ſpeeches were anſwered by a great deal of ſubmiſſion and humility by them both, they teſtifying that pride could make no advantage on their ſouls by the praiſes of the Queen, but rather inſpired them with a generous valour and deſire of ſerving her. After they had aſſured her of their utmoſt endeavours, and given her their Council how to proceed, they received her commands to go meet them with their victorious army. She could not chuſe but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her ſad reſentments for their ſo ſudden departute, which ſhe did with notable addreſs, and in general terms, but <hi>Araterus</hi> might have ſeen that if it might have ſtood with his honour and her ſafety, he ſhould have ſtayed behind. The Soldiers having received a largeſs from the Queen, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of greater rewards, marched with a courage and reſolution that already aſſured them of the victory over their enemies. The General that received the former overthrow, hoping to regain what he had loſt, was ſo raſh and unadviſed to hazard another battle, wherein he reſolved to dye or regain his former honour, knowing it would be an in ſupportable diſgrace to appear any more before his Queen, having loſt it through his own unskilfullneſs,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:51633:136"/> more then his cowardize; But fortune reſolving the victory for <hi>Araterus,</hi> he loſt both his life and the better halfe of the Army in the Conſlict, ſo that the enemies came fleſht with their victories, and tryumphing, till they heard of the loſs of their other Army, which gave ſuch a check to their exultancies, that it half conquered them before the other Army could come to oppoſe them. Fortune that ſeem'd to be ſworn now to <hi>Araterus</hi>'s ſide, gave us the firſt victory, in which the enemy loſt a hundred thouſand men, and twenty thouſand Elephants. Seeking ſtill to ingage them, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained two or three one after another, in all which ſights <hi>Araterus</hi> did ſuch actions, that the moſt envious of them all could not but contribute to his glory, ſeeing they tended to theirs, and their kingdomes preſervation. 'Twas more then once or twice that he ſaved the life of <hi>Peomontile,</hi> he ſlew with his own hand two of the enemies Generals, and by his examples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired others with ſuch courage and animoſity, that he often turned the fortune of the battle, and although reduced to extremities and Exigents, he ſtill came off victorious and tryumphant.

Peace being ſetled in thoſe parts, we returned to <hi>Sinda,</hi> where <hi>Peomontile</hi> and <hi>Araterus</hi> were received by the Queen with ſuch careſſes of joy, and in ſuch ſtate, triumph and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, that the Eaſt never beheld the like.</p>
                  <p>Theſe publick rejoyceings after many weeks beginning to leſſen, the Queen who was generous and noble, (having before acquainted her Uncle <hi>Peomontile</hi> and <hi>Araterus</hi> with her intentions, who gave her their approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) ſent for the Prince of <hi>Sinana:</hi> He who thought it had been to receive the ſentence of death, came with ſo dejected a countenance, that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced the quality he repreſented, and the apprehenſions of which, made him ſpeak, and do things ſo misbecoming a Prince, that the Queen had much ado to endure him in her preſence whilſt ſhe told him: That he now ſaw the fruits of his inſolency, pride and temerity, and that although ſhe had reſpected him above his demerits, and according to that regality which he bore, yet that he had unworthily, and altogether miſbecoming a Prince behaved himſelf. That he ſaw how the number of his men, his threatnings, inſolencies and pride were overthrown by the gods, who protected her innocency againſt his violencies.

The Prince received this ſentence with ſome ſign of joy, and though it was ſo little to his glory ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded the Queens Mercy. According to her order he was conducted to the Frontiers of the kingdome, with all the other priſoners which ſhe had taken, with them ſhe ſent a letter to his father the king of <hi>Sinana,</hi> in which ſhe old him: That 'twas her deſire to live in peace &amp; amity with all her neighbour-Princes, but eſpecially with him, the intereſts of whoſe kingdome her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had alwayes made their own. That ſhe wondred he was ſo unadviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to follow the temerity of his ſon, and to ingage himſelf in a Warre ſo unjuſt and illegal, thereby breaking thoſe Leagues which ſhe ever had kept inviolable. That what ſhe had done, was but in her own defence, and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:51633:137"/> to keep her and her Subjects from ruin and deſtruction, and therefore that he was to thank himſelf and fortune for his overthrow and loſs. That for her part ſhe deſired not to make uſe of her good fortune, nor advantages that ſhe had againſt him, either in aſſaulting him in an hoſtile way, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her Armies were ready, and ſufficient enough to endamage him, or to uſe that violence to him in the perſon of his Son, which might ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie to all the world. That as the gods and the juſtneſs of her cauſe had rendred her victorious, ſo her generoſity and innate goodneſs had rendred her mercifull, that thereby he might ſee ſhe had no other ends then to conſerve her kingdome in peace and proſperity, though as he now knew, ſhe was able to defend her ſelf from his and others Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, That ſhe had ſent him his ſon, and had given him his liberty without ranſome or intreary, notwithſtanding the wrongs he had done her, and the ruin he had endeavoured for a requital of all her ſavours ſhe had ſhewed him, whilſt he remained in her Court. This letter ſo full of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity and obligements wrought much on the King of <hi>Sinana,</hi> who was raiſing an Army twice ſo big as the former to repair his loſſes, and made him preſently deſiſt, and receive thoſe the Queen had ſent with his ſon, with careſſes and acknowledgements. The evil nature of that Prince was nothing moved with the Queens generoſity, and ſeeing himſelf out of her power, he would have inſtigated his father againſt her, and have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to go on with his levies, but notwithſtanding his inſinuations, the King ſent an Embaſſador to the Queen with ſo many rich preſents that it ſufficiently ranſomed the Prince, and diſcharged the charges of the war, giving him in charge alſo to conclude a peace more ſtrict than before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. This was effected, and they returned from the Queen ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well ſatisfied with her generoſity and liberality, with preſents worthy of her quality to the King their Maſter, which (as we heard) he received with wonderfull acknowledgement and addreſs.</p>
                  <p>Peace being thus concluded, and every thing ſetled with prudence and care, the Queen began to give eaſe to her thoughts, and entertain thoſe pleaſing Idea's which in the midſt of all her troubles often interrupted her. The firſt thing ſhe did was in rewarding thoſe who had done valiantly, and ſerved her faithfully. <hi>Araterus</hi> you may be ſure, taſted of her liberality, ſhe made him <hi>Birebaſſe</hi> or Governour of a province, making him by her ſavours and his places the ſecond in the Kingdome next to <hi>Peomontile.</hi> There was none but ſaid he deſerved it, and that the favours of the Queen could not be better beſtowed; the mouth of envy it ſelf being ſtopt by his vertues, &amp; by the port that he had carried amongſt the people: Indeed all ſpoke for him, and deſir'd to render him careſſes &amp; acknowledgements: his valour and vertue ſtill lived in their memories, and his continual Courteſie, made it ſpring there eternally. Truly his mediocrity was admirable, for if in all his formet misfortunes I had noted a conſtancy hardly parallelable, and that without dejection, <hi>I</hi> could not obſerve in all his height of glory the leaſt exultancy or pride, but what he received was with a ſpirit full of tranquillity, and he would never have received ſuch high favours and honours, but that he thought it would render him more conſiderable for his aſpiring Love. Indeed that ſtill conſerv'd its flames, and all thoſe heats that had agitated him in the wars, proceeded from that, he makeing me his confident, often told me of its ardencies, and how unſupportable they began to grow, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the hopes, the propheſie, and inclinations of the Queen inſpired him with. Thoſe indeed maintained him in a tranquillity not uſual with Lovers, and conſerved him from their diſquiets a long time. He found the favours of the Queen ſo obliging, and her careſſes and endearments ſo favourable, that he began to hope he ſhould arrive at the ſumme

                     </gap>his happineſs. The Queen being of an imperious humour, had grievous conteſts with her love, ſo that her ſoul was agitated continually with contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and oppoſing thoughts. And as ſhe related her ſelf to <hi>Araterus</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they were ſuch as theſe. She conſidered the inequality between <hi>Araterus</hi> and her ſelf, that he was nothing but by her creation, that her ſelf was one of the potenteſt Queens of the Eaſt, that ſhe had out of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious humour refuſed the greateſt Princes in the world, that ſuch a match would be a blur to her honour, a grief to her Subjects, and make her a ſcorn to her neighbours, and to thoſe Princes whom ſhe had deſpiſed. That to think to enjoy him any other way, her vertue did prohibit, and ſhe believed that her kingdome could not tempt his. Therefore ſhe believed her love was to be deſpiſed, rejected and ſtrove againſt, ſeeing it led her to ſuch prejudice and inconveniencies. This made her reſolve often to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe her ſelf, to hate her ſelf, and to account her ſelf worthy of ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſcorn: ſometimes ſhe would baniſh him or confine him to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or prohibit him the Court; and by baniſhing him out of her memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, repreſs thoſe flames his preſence fomented. But this his innocency, and what he had done for her oppoſed; but chiefely love it ſelf could not yield to his ſeparation; that exſuſcitated for its defence ſuch thoughts as theſe: That although ſhe were a Queen, and enjoyed all the riches, pomp and pleaſure imaginable, yet that Love was a content that far furpaſſed them all, and ſo that if ſhe ſhould enjoy the greateſt Prince on the earth, it could not render her ſo happy as the enjoyment of one ſhe loved ſhould, though ne're ſo mean. That <hi>Araterus</hi> conſidering the diſparity would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt want the imperious humours of Princes, and make it the whole ſcope of his actions to ſerve her faithfully, and love her continually. That the gods never make any diſtinction of perſons by their greatneſs, but by their goodneſs; not by their Nobility, but by their vertue, and that the meaneſt on earth if they follow the Precepts of vertue, are capable of an <hi>Apotheoſis</hi> and deification: That ſeeing the gods reſpected not the Nobility of perſons, ſo much as their vertue, they ſhould endeavour to imitate them, for the nearer they appproached to the gods in their actions, the nearer they ſhould be to them when extinct. That her greatneſs and regality de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the mutual wheele of fortune, as if ſhe ſhould be caſt from her Throne, there would be but little ſigne of her highneſs, greatneſs and rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: That the Original of Soveranity was only uſurpation, got by the ſword and fortune, that in right the moſt vertuous ſhould be the moſt noble. That ſhe was able to make <hi>Araterus</hi> equal with the greateſt Princes in the Eaſt, that what he had done for her had merited it, that his valor and vertue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it; that his perſon, both for behaviour and make, was not to be equalled, that there was nothing to be objected to him, but that he was no Prince, which her love was to diſpenſe with. Between ſuch diverſity of thoughts ſhe was continually cruciated, and made her undergo a torment that could not be eaſed by all thoſe pleaſures that accompany the converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſuch eminent perſonages. Theſe troubles continuing, put her into ſo deep a melancholy, that every body wondred at it, knowing it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to her nature and diſpoſition. And for that ſhe had not revealed it to any, ſhe received the more torment and pain. Amongſt all the Confidents, ſhe had a kinſwoman, whom ſhe loved above her reſt, and to whom ſhe alwayes poured out all her ſecrets, but this ſhe accounted ſo criminal, that ſhe had not as yet ſpoken of it: However remembring the wiſdome and good counſel ſhe had alwayes found in <hi>Marina</hi> (ſo they called her) ſhe was conſtrained after a long time of ſadneſs to diſcover her thoughts to her, and commanded her to tell her what ſhe was to do in that caſe. <hi>Marina</hi> (as <hi>Araterus</hi> knew from her own mouth afterwards) was ſurprized at the Queens
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:51633:138"/> diſcourſe, and would fain have excuſed her ſelf; but ſhe preſſing her, and reiterating her commands, ſhe ſpake in theſe words.</p>

And in my jorney that I made hither, I receiv'd my Notes, and gave them a new impreſs in my memory, that I might be able to recount to you theſe things faithfully and exactly. Let this then ſerve for all, that you may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous, nor account my memory prodigious, though ſome things, were I to live eternally, <hi>I</hi> could never forget. <hi>Marina</hi> I ſay being conſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Madam! I confeſs I am extremely unfit to adviſe you in a matter I had never any experience of, when it may be too, that I ſhall contradict your opinion, if I tell you I think there is no neceſſity or compulſion, but a generous and reſolute ſoul may diſcuſs, I mean, that we may diſengage our ſelves from that troubleſome paſſion, ſo much cryed out upon by all the world, when we will; if we reſolve not to betray our ſelves to its al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements. This is ſo tickliſh a ſubject, that I fear to ſpeak any thing of it, leſt if you follow my advice, and it ſhould not ſucceed, you would put the blame upon my Councel, rather then on that inevitable fatalitie which oftentimes accompanys the tranſactions of love. It is very dangerous, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and I know that thoſe who uſe to adviſe in ſuch affairs, have that quality which I have not; that is, flattery: for 'tis alwayes known that thoſe troubled with this paſſion that blinds the reaſon and underſtanding, though they ask the Counſel of others, and ſeem much to deſire it, yet they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome follow any but the dictates of their paſſion, or that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, or correſponds with their own inclinations. It may be you may wiſh that my Counſel may not be repugnant to your Love, or to ſay better, that I may flatter you, this might pleaſe beſt your paſſion, but not your reaſon, and ſo long as paſſion is ſtrongeſt, thoſe Counſels will be beſt pleaſing that are moſt agreeable to it. I confeſs I had rather be ſilent, but ſeeing I muſt obey your commands, I think it my love and duty to ſpeak my mind apert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and freely, without conſidering whether it be pleaſing, ſo it be profitable. I confeſs my judgement may be weak, and I may not ſee ſo clearly into things as your ſelf or others, yet ſeeing 'tis your pleaſure to have my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, I had rather err for lack of wiſdome, and in ſincerity, than out of intereſt and ſubtilty. In a word, <hi>Madam,</hi> what I adviſe is, that you give no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to this paſſion, but ſeek to forget it with all poſſible ſpeed you may, ſeek alwayes to divert your mind, let not your thoughts entertain themſelves upon it, ſeparate <hi>Araterus</hi> from your ſight, for undoubtedly if you entertain it, 'twill do you more hurt than all thoſe enemies you have ſubdued could, and ſo <hi>Araterus,</hi> though innocently, is a rebel, a traitor, and deprives you of your liberty. I cannot tell which would have been worſe, the loſs of your kingdome, or this which hath befallen you, if you do not ſpeedily remedy it, for the privation of your reaſon, underſtanding and judgement, is worſe than the loſs of all the pleaſure of ſenſe, or what ever you now injoy, ſo that although <hi>Araterus</hi> hath given you your life and kingdome, he hath given you too theſe diſquiets, that are leſs ſupportable than death, and by it he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as great an enemy, as he was a friend. I know, Madam, that he is innocent, and I ſpeak not this becauſe I have any prejudice againſt him, I confeſs that he is worthy of all the honor and grace that your Majeſty hath ſhewn him, and his merits cannot be too highly rewarded, but by your ſelf. You love him, Madam, I know your vertue will not permit the leaſt thought ariſe of any baſe and infamous injoyment of him: you would I know love
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:51633:138"/> him lawfully, and therefore you muſt ſeat him on the ſame Throne with your ſelf. I confeſs I wiſh him a Crown that he might deſerve you, for do but conſider the difference between you, and you cannot but confeſs your action will be ſomething unworthy of your ſelf. I heard you ſay for your ſelf, that the gods were no reſpecters of perſons; What then? in this we are not to regard them ſo much as men, for things indifferent they leave to our own judgements and reaſon: I confeſs it is no ſin for you to marry the meaneſt of your Subjects, neither is it any thing to the gods, but yet it would be an action that would render you a ſcorn to men. But I cannot but think that it is the will of the gods that Princes ſhould joyn with Princes, and in my judgement it ſeems to be more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, becauſe they have a more peculiar care over them than over other men, they repreſenting the perſons and Majeſty of the gods, and are exempt from puniſhments, but from the hand of heaven. The Queen here interrupting her Conſident. I am much pleaſed with thy zeal (ſaid ſhe ſmiſing and bluſhing together) but thou doſt ſee it hath carried thee from the purpoſe. Let me anſwer thee thy laſt inference, which is, that it is the will of the gods we ſhould match with Princes, I am ſure that it is the will of the gods that we ſhould imitate their actions, Do not they I pray create Princes, and Kings, and not regarding greatneſs give it to the vertuous? And ſhall not I do ſo too, in matching with this generous ſtranger? If the vertuous be worthy of Crowns, why ſhould we be aſhamed to conſer it on them? But what doſt thou ſpeak of the gods protecting of Princes more than others? be it ſo, is it for their own ſakes, or for the ſakes of thoſe under them; 'Tis true, the gods do ſeem to have a greater care over Princes than every private man; Why? not becauſe they are born great and noble, but becauſe they rule others: ſo that in protecting and directing them, they protect and keep their whole kingdome: And I make no queſtion, that if a begger came to the Crown (which muſt be by the help of the gods, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencies of the ſtars, their inferior operators) the gods would more ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly regard him on the Throne, or coming thereto, than before, becauſe then they work generally, and their actions are more inſpected; therefore it is not the perſon, but the place, or the perſon for the places ſake, that the gods ſeem to have ſo extraordinary care of Princes more than others: And again the actions of Princes are more noted and inſpected than others, every one looks what befalls them, and a little preſervation makes a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rejoycing, being all interreſſed in the perſon of the Prince: And I am perſwaded that if the actions and lives of many of the vulgars were known and inſpected, the providential care of the gods would be no leſs ſeen than in thoſe of the Prince. So that their protection will be no leſs favourable to <hi>Araterus</hi> when he is made a Prince, than if he were born ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Love</hi> (ſaith <hi>Marina</hi>) can never be diſputed againſt, for it alwayes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes its deſenders with ſubtle and unanſwerable arguments, I know I muſt cede to your judgement if you undertook to anſwer me, but let it be ſo then, Madam, that <hi>Araterus</hi> ſhall have the protection of the gods, if he hath yours, yet I ſhall never yield to think well of this amorous evil on which I have heard ſo many complaints, that I even tremble to think that you are infected with it. The Queen ſeeing her Conſident ſo zealous in a cauſe ſhe was ignorant of, ſmil'd, and told her ſhe would do her utmoſt endeavours to decuſs a paſſion which ſhe could not approve of.</p>
                  <p>She did ſo indeed, love and reaſon continually combated, and ſhe thought ſhe had gain'd the victory; and to do it more effectually, ſhe began to eloyn her ſelf from <hi>Araterus;</hi> ſhe very ſeldom ſaw him, ſhe did not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs him as ſhe had uſed; and ſhe uſed all the means ſhe thought requiſite for ſo hard a matter. But it was in vain for her to conteſt with ſo potent an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:51633:139"/> a Deity that overpowered her, and made her, ſpite of her teeth, break all her reſolutions at the very ſight of him; what ever ſhe had reſolved and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, his ſight carried ſo many charms that it made them fall to nothing. She ſaw at laſt that 'twas impoſſible for her to recover her former quietude, which made her tell <hi>Marina</hi> after many moneths diſquiets and endeavours to follow her Councel, that her fate was inevitable, that there was nothing but death, or <hi>Araterus,</hi> that could terminate thoſe pains and torments, that her paſſion made her undergo. Seeing that is ſo (ſaid <hi>Marina,</hi> troubled at thoſe continual agitations which ſhe ſaw in the Queen) and that there is a neceſſity not to be avoided, that <hi>Araterus</hi> is deſtin'd to be your tormentor. Let us believe that 'tis not without a ſpecial deſign of heaven; lets ſeek to content you, quiet your paſſion, and make him happy. Madam, what ever averſion I have to this paſſion, added ſhe, your intereſt ſhall make me plead for it, ſeeing you cannot follow my counſel, make uſe of me, and I will follow the Dictates of your love, for I profeſs it is impoſſible for me to ſee ſo much trouble in you, without endeavouring your content. The Queen imbraceing her, told her, that ſhe ſhould never do any thing unworthy her ſelf, or contrary to the vertue ſhe had profeſt, That ſhe would ſooner die than exhibite her paſſion, and that ſhe wholly remitted her ſelf into her hands, profeſſing that ſhe had rather die and baniſh <hi>Araterus,</hi> than blemiſh her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, although nothing in the world was more pleaſant to her fight, and though it was impoſſible but that ſhe muſt ſtill love him. In the mean time <hi>Araterus</hi> perceiving the eloynment of the Queen, and being debar'd of that happineſs of ſeeing her often, for all his hopes, fell into ſo deep a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy that all his friends perceiv'd it in his looks, and notwithſtanding the careſſes of <hi>Peomontile</hi> who affected him as much as if he had been his own ſon, and his other friends which his generoſity and goodneſs had gained, he could not be comforted. But what ever they read in his face, he was too ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to diſcover the leaſt thought of his heart to any but me, and they all believed that it was an effect of his eloynment from his Countrey. This made all his friends uſe thoſe divertiſements which they thought capable to make him forget it, never a day but he was careſſed in ſuch high termes and manner, that the greateſt Prince of the Orient could not have more. Sometimes muſick, balls and dancing was his divertiſement, ſometimes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with horſes, ſometime Charriot-races, ſometimes fighting on Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, a pleaſing and delightfull ſport, and ſometimes hunting: but all theſe being conſtrained, and contrary to his humour, it abated nothing of that ſadneſs which triumpht over him. The Queen having not ſeen him a great while, being on purpoſe retired from the Court, with an intent to overcome her ſelf, when ſhe ſaw him, was wonderfully troubled to perceive thoſe aſſured marks of trouble and ſadneſs in his face, ſhe could not forbear asking him if any one had diſobliged him? Who had given him cauſe of diſcontent or anger? if that any of the Court had oppugn'd him? or any of her kingdome offended him? what it was he wanted; if that it was the remembrance of his Countrey? ſhe told him what ever was in the kingdom was at his ſervice, that he was amongſt his friends, and that there was nothing in her power to grant him, but he might aſſure himſelf of it. To all which he anſwered, with a reſpect that ſuch obliging ſpeeches requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But ſtill diſſembling his trouble, he gave her very little ſatisfaction. Not being contented, ſhe returns to <hi>Marina,</hi> and having opened her mind to her, and wondring at the trouble of <hi>Araterns,</hi> Love having alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made her ſuſpitious, ſhe by the advice of her Conſident ſent for me. One for that purpoſe having watched their opportunity, told me the Queen had commanded them to conduct me to her: wondring what ſhould be the matter, <hi>I</hi> immediatly followed the Meſſenger, who having led me to the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:51633:139"/> pallace, I was had into a chamber by one of <hi>Marina</hi>'s Maids, where I found the Queen and <hi>Marina</hi> together. After that I ſhewed the reſpect that I ought, the Queen commanding me to riſe, enquired of me for my maſter, for ſo I called him all the while I had been in that Countrey) and very dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly began to ſpeak of the ſadneſs ſhe had noted in his face, which ſhe ſaid ſhe believed was the effect of ſome diſcontent that he had taken, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me that his generoſity having hid it from her, ſhe believed I could not be ignorant of it, and that it was requiſite ſhe ſhould know it, being beſt able to remove it, for ſhe doubted not but that ſome of her ſubjects had given him ſome cauſe for diſcontent unjuſtly, and that I ſhould therefore diſcover it, though my Maſters generoſity would not permit himſelf to do it, that ſhe might puniſh the author of it, for an example to others. After I had heard this, I told her that 'twas requiſite ſhe ſhould be obeyed in all things, that I was ſorry I could not exactly obey her commands, for that I was ignorant that any of her ſubjects or any other had given him the leaſt cauſe for diſcontent, that I believed he had ſo acquired their loves by her favours, that none would be ſo malicious as to do any extraordinary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that might diſquiet my maſter, and that I knew it was no ſmall thing could move the tranquillity of his mind.

I know not what it was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe could perceive any thing by my countenance, ſhe did not believe me. She told me that <hi>Araterus</hi> had given her the knowledge of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his life, and that not being tyed by the bonds of affection, ſhe did not believe thoſe of nature could cauſe ſo great trouble: and that if it were ſo, ſhe knew he would have deſired her aſſiſtance for the reward of all his pains and good ſervices, for to have returned into his Countrey. I replyed that it might be, he could not be ſo diſreſpectfull as yet, conſidering the eſteem ſhe had of him, and the favours ſhe had done him, as to ask a thing which he imagined might be diſpleaſing to her, that although he were inferior to no Prince in his own Countrey, and that the gods had given him an eſtate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nobility of his birth, where he might injoy all the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes there, that he now enjoyed except her preſence and ſervice, yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that he preſer'd that to all the reſt, and made him ſo back-ward in asking a thing which he could not but deſire. This I ſpake for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of <hi>Araterus,</hi> and to beget a good opinion of his Nobility and birth in the Queen, which took very good effect, and much advantaged his love. I am ſorry (ſaid ſhe) that <hi>Araterus</hi> never intimated thus much to me before, and I muſt lay all the blame on my ignorance that I have not reſpected him as I ought: <hi>I</hi> know, Madam, (replyed <hi>I</hi>) that he eſteems your ſervice the greateſt honour and happineſs in the world. That ſha'nt excuſe him (ſaid ſhe) for hiding from me his birth and quality. But is it ſo as you tell me, added ſhe earneſtly. I ſaw that it would be for the intereſt of <hi>Araterus,</hi> and if he proſecuted his Love, <hi>I</hi> thought it would be impoſſible otherwiſe to arrive at a happy end, thetefore being imboldened, I am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified his birth, and gave her ſuch an ingenuous relation of him, making him no leſs than a Prince, that <hi>I</hi> ſaw a kind of joy ſparkling in her eyes, before <hi>I</hi> had finiſhed my relation. Many things concerning his Countrey, and our adventures on the ſea, ſhe had heard from him before, and finding them to

Have you told me every thing? (ſaid ſhe) have you omitted no paſſages. But one, Madam, (ſaid I) which I am not ſure that I may tell without an infidelity to my maſter.

I was fain to tell him if he would not acknowledge what I had ſaid of him for a verity, I ſhould be accounted an impoſtor to the Queen, which would reflect on him and it may be bring himſelf into ſuch diſeſteem as not to be believed, That what I had done was for his fidelity, that on it depended the good or bad ſucceſs of his love, that 'twas impoſſible otherwiſe to arrive at the end propoſ'd That he would both ruin me and undoe himſelfe, and both he looked upon I not better than impoſtors: with ſuch like reaſons <hi>I</hi> was forc'd to perſwade him to a thing which others would have been too apt to have taken upon themſelves in ſuch a place and on ſuch an occaſion.

                  <p>The Queen being the daughter of <hi>Amariſia</hi> King of this mighty domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Princeſſe of the neither <hi>India,</hi> was brought up in her infancy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the way and manner of this Kingdome. She had two younger ſiſters but they and her mother dying when ſhe was very young, they left her to receive all the care and love of her father who indeed brought her up according to the tenderneſſe and delicateneſſe of her ſpirit. Her beauty in her infancy gave an aſſured ſign that 'twould be raire and admirable, and her wit in every thing was ſeen comparable. She had the features, and beauty of her mother, the wiſdome and underſtanding of her father, the one being the beautifulleſt of her time, the other the wiſeſt and moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his, ſo that this conjunction in the daughter, gave the whole Kingdome hopes of an extream happineſſe aſſoon as ſhe was capable to Raigne, <hi>Amaiſia</hi> as if he would not hinder her from making uſe of thoſe gifts the Gods had given her, dyed. 'Tis five years ſince, and though ſhe were then but fifteen, yet the whole Kingdome can teſtifie, they never enjoyned a more peaceable, and happy time, till thoſe late warrs. Her prudence and wiſdome being ſhowne in a thouſand occaſions, both that the ſame of her beauty ſpreading thorow the whole Eaſt, begot her as many lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and adorers as there were Princes in the <hi>Orient.</hi> There is hardly any of them but either came or ſent to lay their Crowns at her feet, and all deſired the happineſſe of poſſeſſing her. All propoſitions of Marriage ſhe carried with ſo much addreſſe, that ſhe ſtill kept her ſelfe free, and incenſed none.</p>
                  <p>But at laſt the Prince of <hi>Sinana</hi> having heard of her by the mouth of fame thorow the large extent of his fathers dominions, came as others had done, with a traine ſutable to the quality of ſo great a Prince, to <hi>Sinda.</hi> This
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:51633:141"/> Prince though indeed he is the moſt potent and mightieſt in the world, yet pleaſed the Queen leſs then all the reſt, of thoſe that proffered her their ſervice. For ſhe having a noble and tranſcendent ſoule, regarded not ſo much the greatneſs of their Kingdomes, as the habit, and virtues of their minds. She had alſo a pierceing Judgment, and could take an exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their inclinations, by the leaſt of their actions. She preſently found this Prince of a moſt turbulent ſpirit, raſh, heady, and fierce, which was very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to her gentle diſpoſition, which made her little regard either his beauty, handſomeneſſe, or greatneſſe, believing that ſhe could not be happy but with thoſe, whoſe diſpoſitions ſhould agree with hers, as well as their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. However ſhe uſed him according to his birth, and though ſhe had a great deſire to be rid of him, yet ſhe entertained him nobly, and royally. The Prince no ſooner ſaw her, but being very ſuſceptable it ſeems, fell in Love with thoſe ardencies &amp; impatiences, as ſhe had not ſeen before, though truly Iam perſwaded 'twas rather an effect of his ambition than his Love; &amp; truly I think he lov'd his Kingdom better than her, and if I am not greatly miſtaken 'twas that he ſought, and theſe wars hath made it appear ſo. Nevertheleſſe the Queens ſpeeches neither gave him hope nor diſpare but uſing him gently according to her own nature, he remain'd with her agreat while. I will never ſtand to trouble you with the proteſtations of his love nor addreſſes, ſince they were all falſe &amp; feign'd: but her replys were ſtill modeſt, &amp; agreeable to her condition. At laſt he grew ſo troubleſome to her &amp;, preffing, that ſhe was fain a little to make ſhew of her diſlike, and finding his humor imperious, and baſe, ſhe ſaw that gentleneſſe and gallantry could not work upon him. Likeing him worſe every day than other, ſhe would not permit him ſo often to ſee her as he uſed, and by many other wayes a well as words ſhe ſhewed her diſlike of him, though ſhe entertained him with as great ſtate as ever, and omitted nothing of formalities, for him to take exceptions at. But ſhe continued her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiage ſo, that he too well ſaw he was ſlighted, which ſo diſpighted him, that it inſpired him with more heat and anger, than love: for he thought the Queen reſpecting his greatneſs would not have denyed his ſuit. Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as he was, he yet diſſembled it, and cauſed the fight on the Elephants to be kept in the City in honor of the Queen propoſing the effigies of the Queen for the prize, making no queſtion but the adverſe party would permit him to carry it away at laſt, being a uſual partiality where rivals do not meet, if that he were not ſtrong enough to oppoſe them. The Queen willing to make uſe of this occaſion, ſent for ſome of the chief of the adverſe party, and charged them not to uſe their uſual reſpect, but to do their utmoſt endeavour to obtain the prize. The thing was effected as ſhe would wiſh, for when the ſport was almoſt finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that the Prince thought they would have retreated, and left him victor, he found himſelf deceived, for preſſing forward with exceeding vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence they gain'd the place where the prize ſtood, and in ſpite of all reſiſtance took it away, and according to direction offered it at the feet of the Queen, who gave them a chain of pearls and diamonds for a requital. The Prince was extremely vext at this diſgrace, though he diſſembled it as much as he could, but the Queen on every occaſion brought it into his memory, and in a way of gallantry jeared him handſomly, but ſo as he could take no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to be angry. In fine having received many repulſes, and beginning to diſpair, ſeeing the averſeneſs of the Queen, he began to ſet other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a work, and employing all his art and ſubtilty, by gaining thoſe whom he perceived the King moſt favoured, and by exceeding rich gifts and preſents, engaged them to fill the Queens ears with Encomiums, and to perſwade her to marry him, by endeavouring to exhibit how advantagious it would be the kingdom. The Queen notwithſtanding all this would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but finding out his practiſes, deteſted him the more for ſuch undue

That very morning which he intended to depart, the quarter where he lay not being far from the Queens, he was come to the gallery which looks into the garden to attend the Queens riſing. It ſeems from that place he had eſpied, that one who attended the Queen came into the garden by a private pair of ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irs, which was alwayes bar'd up but at ſuch time as the Queen made uſe of them, which was ſome evenings for her private recreations, or when ſhe went to bath in the night. The Queen having gone that way but that night, thoſe bars that render the paſſage ſecure were not put up, and the Prince knowing whether thoſe ſtairs led, and ſeeing the door open by the maids negligence, had a deſire to take leave of the Queen privately, that he might the better teſtifie his diſpleaſure. Getting into the garden he aſcends thoſe ſtairs, and finding the paſſage free, he entred the Queens Chamber ſo unexpectedly, that we were amazed.</p>
                  <p>She was but juſt riſen, and there being none but my ſelf and two more of her Attendants with her, ſhe was afraid. But whilſt he ſtop'd to take a view of her neck and breaſts, which were not covered, ſhe recovered her ſurprize, and taking a Mantle which I gave her, ſhe caſt it about her neck, attending what the Prince would ſay. Rage was already painted in his looks, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting all the reſpect which he ought to have had, he told her very boldly, that he was not to excuſe himſelf, ſeeing fortune had ſo happily favoured his deſign, for breaking a civility which he was not ignorant of. That he could not ſay it was love that had cauſed that tranſport, but that it was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he had to propound one queſtion to her, which was, Whether ſhe would grant him that grace, for which he had ſo long ſued, or to ſee her Kingdom deſtroyed with an Army of twenty-hundred-thouſand men? The paleneſs which fear had painted in her Majeſties cheeks, anger at this demand had converted into red, and anſwering with indignation, ſhe told him, that it was impoſſible for him to gain that by threats, which he could not obtain by intreaties: That for her part ſhe had long ago reſolved in her ſelf, that ſhe had rather meet him as a ſoe, than conſent to what he deſired. And in fine, that ſhe made no queſtion, but that if his temerity did partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate him to ſuch actions, ſhe ſhould find men enough to chaſtize him for his folly.</p>
                  <p>This anſwer ſo enraged him, that he could not diſtinctly ſpeak a word more, but mutteringly we underſtood that he vowed he would be as good as his word, and make her ſue for that, which now ſhe ſo ſuperbouſly denyed. Haſtning thence, within an hour he had ſet ſail, leaving the Queen very much ſatisfied with his departure, and very little fearing his threats. When he was arrived in his own Kingdomes, holding his reſolutions, he ſent an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald to denounce War againſt her, if that ſhe had not bethought her ſelf, and would not conſent to his deſires. The Queen ſent him word, that ſhe could not yield to his demands, but that if he would break that ancient League between the two Kingdomes, ſhe ſhould be ready to defend her ſelf againſt all his threats add endeavours. After this ſhe gave order to <hi>Peomontile</hi> for the muſtering of her forces, and the raizing enough, ſufficient to defend her Kingdome, which was done effectually, and augmented by your ſelf for the Kingdomes happineſs and your own glory, the gods having determined their ſubverſion by your hand.</p>

                     <hi>Araterus</hi> had but given her thanks for this which ſhe had told him, when there came one to give them notice that the Queen was returned, to whom they preſently went; <hi>Araterus</hi> ſpending that evening in her company; for ſome following dayes he was wholly taken up, in receiving the viſits, careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and complements of his friends, all of them teſtifying their reſentments for his diſguiſeing himſelf, and that with ſo much addreſs and civility, that he ſtood amazed to ſee it ſo far from <hi>Rome.</hi> The Queen deſirous it ſhould be known, cauſed it privated to be declared, ſo that it was ſoon known pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly through the whole City, every one regarding him as a Prince, and worthy of that which he aſpir'd to. And notwithſtanding <hi>Araterus</hi>'s deſire to the contrary, ſhe cauſed him to be ſerved with more ſtate, and after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Princes of that Countrey, encreaſing both the number of his ſervants, and the riches of his pallace, ſo that his train and port was little leſs then the Queens, his quality ſtifling envy, that having a kind of reſpect to greatneſs. The Queen had now nothing to oppoſe againſt <hi>Araterus,</hi> and her joy had been compleat but for that which I had told her concerning him, that it was love that troubled him. This cauſed a new Certamen in her thoughts, ſhe began to be jealous, ſhe feared <hi>Marina,</hi> ſhe thought on the faireſt in the Court, ſhe watched <hi>Araterus</hi> to ſee if ſhe could diſcover her: ſhe hoped it might be her ſelf, and yet ſhe feared to have it ſo, leſt her ſeverity ſhould increpate his boldneſs. She was loth it ſhould be any other, and yet ſhe could not conſent that it ſhould be ſhe, ſo that ſhe feared what ſhe deſired. She found trouble enough in theſe Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Not long after <hi>Marina</hi> being alone with <hi>Araterus,</hi> they ſell into a diſcourſe concerning the Prince of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nana, Araterus</hi> complaining that the gods had not furniſht that Prince with vertues ſutable to his other qualities and greatneſs, that he might have been worthy of the happineſs he ſought for; calling it an overſight of the gods to give any one the goods of body and of fortune, and not thoſe of the mind to employ them rightly, when all three conjoyn'd together, makes the Poſſeſſor happy, the one illuſtrating the other. <hi>Marina,</hi> who hath wit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, told him, that it was a kind of impartiality of the gods ſo to diſtribute their favours, that none might be wanting of their gifts, and that (it may be) according to their own wiſhes, this man hath honour and riches, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beauty and wit, a third vertue and grace, all which in one man would be too much, and which is not ſeen in an age, every one contented with his own, ſhews the variety of gifts of the gods, and their impartiality. But faith ſhe, were it in your choice, which would you chuſe? I ſhould quickly chuſe thoſe of the mind, before thoſe of the body or fortune (replyed <hi>Araterus</hi>) for to have the other without the firſt, is to have the ring without the ſtone, and truly without wit, will, power, judgement, and the like, the goods of fortune cannot be made uſe of rightly, and they are rather fair beaſts then men, but the moſt deformed man is more excellent than the lovelieſt beaſt, ſo in my judgement thoſe that have the goods of the mind, are to be prefer'd to thoſe that have either thoſe of body or fortune: You ſpeak not like a Lover (ſaith <hi>Marina</hi>) for he profers the object of his paſſion
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:51633:142"/> above all things, which you know is to be accounted amongſt the goods of fortune, for if he ſacrifices his life, and I am ſure, he looſes his reaſon, judgement and underſtanding, with all the goods of the mind. Fair <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi> ſaid he, I would not have you count me among theſe unreaſonable men. No, ſaith ſhe, I have obſerved of late a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But he told her, that it had not made him looſe his reaſon, nor underſtanding, for that he did it not ſo much out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, as choice. But when <hi>Marina</hi> would have known who his Miſtriſs was, he told her, ſecrecy was the firſt and chief rule of Love, and that to do ſo was to ſhew his diſreſpect to her he loved, by making known the unworthineſs of her ſervant: whatever <hi>Marina</hi> ſaid ſhe could not draw him to a confeſſion ſhe ſo much deſired, but contented her ſelf that ſhe knew from his own mouth that he loved, which gave the Queen more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than ſhe thought ſhe would have gained through her curioſity, being cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified betwixt hope and fear.</p>
                  <p>Half a year paſt away, <hi>Araterus</hi> ſtill continuing in his eſtate, and continually burning in thoſe amorous flames, which ſcorched his ſoul, more then the heat of the Countrey his body. The Queen was not free from the like cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations, though every dayes converſation with him, gave her a clear ſight that ſhe was the object of his love. Love and her high humour had a long certamen, but at laſt love remained victor, and left her contented with the inclinations of her ſervant. The more ſhe conſidered his vertues, the greater her ardencies grew, and was almoſt angry that his love had not forced his reſpect; for in all that height of honour he had not forgot himſelf, nor had the ardency of his affection made him oblivious of the Queen, he ſhewed her as much ſubmiſſion as at the firſt, and as much affection as would ſtand with reſpect. He was too quick-ſighted not to perceive the affection of the Queen, and yer he forbore an agitation, which he had ſome perſwaſions might have been well accepted, but he contented himſelf that he had covertly given her to underſtand his affection, and that he ſaw ſhe underſtood him. Their Converſation was alwayes free, and pleaſing to each other, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred this above the reſt, becauſe it was remarkable for <hi>Araterus</hi>'s diſcovery of himſelf. He was in the company of the Queen, when his love, cauſing a more then ordinary diſquiet in his ſoul, exhibited a kind of ſadneſs in his face, the Queen noteing it, <hi>I</hi> perceive (ſaid ſhe to him) that you have not forgot your Countrey nor your friends, their remembrance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinging our endeavours, ſtill exuſcitate a melancholy that deprives you of the pleaſures of your life, and fruſtrates all our devoyers to make you merry. The favours, Madam, replyed he, which I have received from your bounty, are capable of makeing one forget her native Countrey and friends without regret<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I'le aſſure you I could not account my ſelf more happy were I in my own Countrey in the midſt of my friends and kindred, than I do at this time, having ſo free an acceſs to your Majeſty: and that which you did call melancholy was nothing but a muſe which had carried me to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the immenſity of your favours, and the meanneſs of my deſerts. I can tell you how to pay whatſoever you think you are indebted to me, ſaid the Queen. That is impoſſible, Madam, anſwered <hi>Araterus,</hi> were the whole world at my diſpoſe. 'Tis very eaſie, ſaid ſhe, for it is but the reſolving of one queſtion. That's too eaſie indeed, Madam, replyed he, to repay the leaſt of your favours: you may command it if you pleaſe, and aſſure your ſelf of a reſolution if't be in my power. It is enough, ſaid ſhe, this is that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:51633:143"/> which I deſire to know then, you have confeſt to <hi>Marina</hi> that you affected a Lady of this Court, I would deſire to know who ſhe is, that I may cauſe her to accept of your love and ſervices. <hi>Araterus</hi> was ſtartled at this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, not imagining that the Queen would have asked it, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to anſwer he ſtood confuſed a great while. Study no excuſe, ſaid the Queen) for you have promiſed to reſolve me, if it were in your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and this I am ſure is, therefore I expect you ſhould not vary from your word, but tell me directly. I will ſeek for no excuſe, replyed <hi>Araterus,</hi> ſince you prohibit it, but I muſt crave your pardon, If I beg you to add this to the reſt of your favours, to remit this queſtion, for it will be too much honour for me, and too much trouble to your ſelf, to take notice of my Loves. And for the favour you profer, I am not capable to receive it, my love extending only to admiration, not to any poſſeſſion or enjoyment. Whether <hi>I</hi> can do you any favour or no, it matters not, however you muſt ſatisfie my deſire, ſaid the Queen. I am willing to do it, Madam, ſaid he, but I fear leſt in doing it, I ſhall purchaſe your diſpleaſure, and cauſe you to wiſh that you had not deſired it: for I profeſs, Madam, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my love is of ſo eminent condition, that I ought not to proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than admiration, and to obey out of duty and reſpect. You cannot think that I will be angry, ſaid ſhe, at a thing that I command. I fear it, Madam, ſaid <hi>Araterus,</hi> for what, and if ſuch a wretch as my ſelf ſhould confeſs that you were the object of his paſſion, would not you be extremely angry at his audacity? my crime will be the ſame if you commanded a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of my love. The queen knew not what to anſwer, ſhe ſaw he had confeſt enough, and ſhe knew not how to behave her ſelf; whilſt ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in this confuſion <hi>Araterus</hi> caſting himſelf at her feet, I ſee, Madam, ſaid he, that I have offended you, what ſhould <hi>I</hi> have done if I had confeſt? alas! you may eaſily know how to revenge your ſelf on my folly, my life is at your diſpoſal: I aſſure you I can dye without regret, becauſe it will be glorious that I dye for obeying you. The queen was in ſuch confuſion that ſhe knew not how to ſpeak, but permitting him in that poſture, he was ſeen ſo by the queens uncle, who comming in ſuddenly put a period to their diſcovery any further. They were both exceedingly troubled that <hi>Peomon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> had ſeen <hi>Araterus</hi> in that poſture, for he ſhewed that he wondred at the action, but it brought forth a good effect, and rendred them both happy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their wiſhes. <hi>Araterus</hi> taking his leave, departed, leaving <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omontile</hi> with the Queen, who preſently deſired to know the meaning of <hi>Araterus</hi>'s action. The queen knowing the vertues of her uncle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, if ſhe could poſſible, to regulate her affection according to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, told him all that had paſſed between<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Araterus</hi> and her ſelf, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing either of her deſires or trouble. <hi>Peomontile</hi> after he had conſidered what ſhe had ſaid, told her for his part, he agreed with her choice, and that he did believe the vertues of <hi>Araterus</hi> had made him worthy of the honour, and that he doubted not but that it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the happineſs of the kingdome, he ſeeing as it were a ſpecial hand of the gods guiding him from ſo remote Countries to theirs; and which he hoped might be for their future happineſs. And laſtly, that if ſhe reſolved to admit him to the Throne, he would endeavour the accompliſhment of it to the content of all, and that ſhe ſhould leave the management wholly to him. This extremely rejoycing the queen, ſhe conſented to what he ſaid, and remitted the management of it to him, deſiring him to carry it ſo, that it might be no blur to her honour nor quality, for that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die the Martyr of love, than commit any indiſcrete action. Being it was requiſit that <hi>Araterus</hi> was to be made acquainted with it, <hi>Peomontile</hi> ſent for him, and after he had made him acquainted with the queens reſolutions, he
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:51633:143"/> told him that he ſhould find him ready to ſerve him cordially. You may judge into what an extaſie of joy this news caſt him in, he preſently ran to the Queen, and falling at her feet, proteſted that the poſſeſſion of that Crown wherewith ſhe intended to inveſt him was invaluable, and diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, but the poſſeſſion of her ſelf rendred him ſo happy, that he would not change condition with the gods.

The Queen gave him a gracious reception, and with a pleaſing brow, gave him her hand, a ſign that ſhe confirmed her ſelf his, and upon which he ſeal'd the firſt impreſſa's o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There was nothing now to be hone, but that <hi>Peomontile</hi> might render their deſire pleaſing to the whole kingdome, and that according to the Lawes of the Land, it might be according to the conſent of the Council, for the Queen was ſtudious to obſerve all the ancient Lawes and cuſtomes of the Relam. Therefore nothing could be done till the meeting of the Council, which was to be ſome few moneths after, in the mean time <hi>Araterus</hi> and the Queen, making known their affections, breathed continually in the air of joyes and delights, and both as 'twere conſpiring in one, made a harmony by the conjunction of their ſouls.</p>

                     <hi>Araterus</hi> (not being unmindfull of his friends advanc'd them to dignities and honors; and amongſt the reſt <hi>Cleopotulus,</hi> our firſt entertainer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the favour of the queen, and reſtored to all his former places and dignities.</p>
                  <p>The time at laſt came, and the grand Council of the kingdome met: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had ſpent ſome dayes in their Ceremonies, and had made an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into their affairs, <hi>Peomontile</hi> very ſecretly cauſed the marriage of the queen to be moved in counſel, and after ſome debates it was concluded that the deſire of the Council ſhould be drawn up in a petitory way, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the queen, wherein they would deſire her for the good of her people to enter into the conjugal ſtate, and to be pleaſed to make her choice of any of thoſe Princes that had ſo long ſued to her for that grace, whilſt the Council was convocated, that they might accerding to the antique Cuſtome give their approbation and conſent. This was done accordingly, and delivered to the queen, who by the inſtructions of <hi>Peomontile</hi> the next day went to the Council, and having given them thanks for the care of the welfare of her people, ſhe told them that for her part there was nothing but the good and felicity of her people, that could make her change a condition in which ſhe found ſo much happineſs and content, and to ſhare a kingdome, and reſign ſome part of her liberty, when ſhe might rule freely and alone: But having no other intereſts, but thoſe of her people, ſhe was both free and ready, to do any thing that might be conducing to their happineſs and welfare. That therefore ſhe was willing to ſubmit to the yoak of marriage, becauſe thar ſtate wherein ſhe was would fruſtrate the expectations, and hinder the happineſs of her people. And that they might ſee how clearly ſhe made their intereſts hers, and how ſtudious ſhe was to render them happy in her choice, and how willing to obſerve all cuſtomes, ſhe remitted it wholly to her Uncle and them, and looked whom they pitched upon, without any other conſiderations than thoſe of the good of her people, (which ſhe was ſure they would endeavour) ſhe would admit him into her Throne and bed. They all exceedingly applauded this ſpeech of the queens, and having given her thanks for the honour ſhe did them, they told her it would be too much preſumption in them to make that choice which ſhe left to them, that they
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:51633:144"/> were only to confirm, and not to elige, and that therefore ſhe would be pleaſed to nominate him her ſelf whom ſhe would account worthy of that dignity. She replyed, that ſhe reſolved already to ſtand to what they ſhould decree, and that ſhe left the whole diſpoſe of it to <hi>Peomontile</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: having ſaid this ſhe left them, all praiſing her for the beſt of Queens, and happieſt of Princes. She being departed, and ſeeing that 'twas left to them, they all began to conſider on whom they might pitch. Some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently declared for the Prince of <hi>Sinana,</hi> raiſing up their old intereſts, ſaying, that although they had been at Wars, yet the peace being concluded, it would be a greater honour for the Queen to accept of him now, when they might ſee that it was not any thing but the Queens greatneſs and magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that made her refuſe him, being able to withſtand him, and that ſhe might declare that none could compell her to what they deſired, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they purchaſt the amity of the greateſt, formidableſt and richeſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in the world. But this was oppoſ'd by moſt, who renewed the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons afore the War, and made known the indignation of the Queen to him above any, and that the Queen could not have imagined that any would have propoſed him.

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:51633:145"/> and goodneſs hath left the management of this affair to us, and we ought now to regard how to confirm our future happineſs, and to provide for a continual peace, that our poſterities may enjoy the fruits of what we in our wiſdomes have acted for them: It may be that we may never have the like occaſion as this, let us not therefore conjoyn ſuch diſparing peeces, and make a ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, that may not out laſt half our dayes. Methinks I heard you ask me why this diſparity ſhould be any obſtacle to the happineſs of the kingdome, or ſhould be a juſt let to this marriage? I anſwer you, that concord, amity, and peace, things ſo eſſential to the happineſs of the kingdome cannot har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour long in perſons diſpar in quality, age or manners. Diſagreement is like to happen, and the diſparity after ſome ſmall time will quickly breed diſſentions. Do you not think that the queen, knowing him to be her Creature, and ſo inferiour to her, will not ſtill exerciſe her authority over him, and though he be in the place of an husband, account him in that of a ſervant? Do you not think that he haveing attained the dignity of a king, and the place of a husband will be ever able to bear it, and not rather endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſubjugate her to his Will? will not this think you breed diviſions, diſcords and diſſentions, will not the queen ſtill conſider her dignity, and his inferiority? and will not ſhe think you be obedient, or obſequious to him whom ſhe hath raiſed, as her place, and caſe of matrimony requires? will ſhe not rather look that he ſhould obey her, and cede to her will in all things? which thing conſider your ſelves how prejudicial it would be to a kingdom, where a King cannot freely act but by the conſent and will of another. A thouſand other wayes is this diſparity of births capable of begetting diſunion, diſagreements, and disjunctions, which were they in a private family, or in leſſer perſons of quality were nothing, but in this caſe, in perſons ſo eminent as the King and queen, diſunion and diſagreement cannot but be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the kingdome, and greatly to its diſadvantage. This is a thing ſo obvious, that I need not mention what ſideings, jealouſies, factions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Examples of this kind are frequent, which might induce us to be wiſe by others harms. But ſuppoſe that none of this happen (as the gods grant it may not if this marriage be effected!) but that they live in peace and happy concord, and agreement, nevertheleſs conſider that <hi>Araterus</hi> is one of whom we have had but ſmall experience.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true that he hath ſhewed himſelf valiant and a good Captain, but every good Captain may not make a good King; he may prove fortunate in the field, and unfortunate on the Throne; good in the Camp, but bad in the Court; the diſcipline of which are far different. He may know how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern an Army, and yet not know how to rule a kingdome; Princes are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indued with a capacity from the gods to rule, others to obey. It may be you object in your thoughts, that he hath merited the dignity by his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and having ſaved the kingdome, deſerves the Queen: But conſider hath he not been royally rewarded? and muſt he of neceſſity have the Crown for his pains? he hath ſaved it, and (may be) may alſo ſhew you he hath the art to ruin it. Some (let me tell you) have been very partial in aſcribing ſo much valour to <hi>Araterus,</hi> that hath ecclipſed that of all the <hi>Sornaleans,</hi> againſt all equity and juſtice, and as if he himſelf had beaten all the <hi>Sinanans,</hi> without either help or aſſiſtance. Did not many other valiant men venture their lives as freely, and exhibit their valour as couragiouſly, though they came off not ſo fortunately, nor their deeds ſo much acknowledged? 'Tis true, my Lord, <hi>Peomontiles</hi> life was ſaved by him, but yet I hope, my Lord, knows how
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:51633:145"/> ſufficiently to gratifie him without making him King. Some of you it may be at this inſtant would tell me of the affable, courteous and loving diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Araterus,</hi> his excellent parts, ſweet and winning behaviour, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vertues, moderation and generoſity.</p>
                        <p>I cannot deny but all this appears in him, but who knows not that theſe are ſutable exhibitions, purpoſely prepared to forward his high deſignes, And who knows but that he endures it with regret enough through aſpiring hopes of a kingly dignity, till he hath attained that place, wherein he may exhibit his own nature and diſpoſition freely and uncontroulably. This diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between a Prince, and one of his condition, the one hides himſelf through fear, the other exhibits himſelf freely, having power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to back his enormities: ſo that his vertues will appear nakedly, he acting without fear of puniſhment, or hope of reward. A Prince is left to his will, ſo that his true nature will appear, either vicious or vertuous, when ſuch as <hi>Araterus,</hi> are often exceeding vicious, humble, courteous, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, and what not, in that eſtate which fortune hath brought them into in the world, when coming to a Crown, or higher pitch of dignity, their former vertues are oft-times changed into vices, and have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as odious as they were before loved and eſteemed. Seeing then that men of mean conditions are ſo apt to fain thoſe vertues they have not, and to reſtrain thoſe vices they are naturally prone to, out of a lack of ability to act them, and that if poſſeſſed with real vertues, the danger of change, of dignities and places, moſt commonly works a <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> upon the heart, eſpecially from vertue to vice, it will be far more ſafe for the Queen to take a noble Prince, who having power to act what he pleaſeth, will not be changed when he comes to rule, than one who it may be palliates his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of hope of reigning. For you ſhall know how he acts as he is a Prince, ſo may you expect him when he is a King. Again conſider how diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable it will be for the queen to ſtain that royal blood with the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo mean a perſon: and for my part I believe that when the queen gave us this liberty of electing one to the dignity of enjoying her; ſhe never ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that we would pitch upon one ſo inferior to her, nor could ſhe think that we could have any ſuch thoughts as to believe ſhe would ever act ſo unworthy her ſelf. She could not but think that we would elect a Prince, amongſt her Neighbours, and many Sutours, and becauſe ſhe would not be led by affection, but by that which might conduce to the good of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſhe remitted this election to us, to chooſe which we thought beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe Princes that ſued to her: and I verily believe that if we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate <hi>Araterus</hi> to her, 'twould make her take away the liberty ſhe hath given us, and repent her for our folly. Do you think the people will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>Araterus</hi> as their Soveraign, to one whom they number among themſelves, and ſo inferior to the Majeſty of a Prince: The <hi>Sornaleans</hi> 'its true affect him much, but not ſo much as to create him their King; and I believe if ever he arrive to that dignity, many which now love him, will then hate him, for theſe people were alwayes ambitious to have noble blood to rule them. To conclude, conſider that the gods create Princes to rule, and gives them only ability to reign well, others indeed may uſurp the place, but they moſt commonly bring all men to ruin. What <hi>I</hi> have ſaid, I hope, tends only to the good of my Princeſs, and the welfare and proſperity of my fellow Subjects. Let all things be well weighed and conſidered, that this <hi>man</hi> who hath ended a war happily, may not bring upon us a peace implete with more miſery.</p>

                        <p>I Beſeech the ſame favour that you have granted my Lord <hi>Mauriſhia,</hi> that is, your patience, and diligent attention to what I ſhall ſay: I ſhall endeavour to anſwer this declamation, and detect both his errors and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and I fear his maliciouſneſs. As we ought to ſpeak here fully and freely, for we ought to ſpeak apertly and ſincerely, and as not ſwayed by the favour or fear of others, ſo not drawn aſide by the ſecret malice or grudge of our ſelves. My Lord I doubt was conſcious to his thoughts, that he needed your candid interpretation of that which was not candidly ſpoken, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the malice and envy he bears to <hi>Araterus,</hi> with the vail of his; 'tis for the good of his Prince, and welfare of his Countrey.

                        <p>This buſineſs is weighty, for by this conjunction we and ours hope for hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion dayes, and therefore it is not to be concluded without debate.

I had ſought the whole kingdome in my thoughts, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none fitter than this ſtranger, I nominated him, and that not without reaſon on my ſide. I could give you many, but they will be prolix, and it may be I ſhall have a fitter occaſion after I have removed thoſe obſtacles which my Lord <hi>Mauriſhia</hi> hath caſt in againſt the approving of my Lord <hi>Araterus.</hi> Their malignity is perpicuous enough, though their weight is hardly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. He firſt tells us of their diſparity, and therefore infers it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have a happy conjunction. This may be anſwered in a word, that there is no ſuch diſparity as he ſpeaks of, and although he cannot believe him to be a Prince, yet the queen has, and hath honoured him according to his dignity. Thoſe that are acquainted with him cannot but ſee all the marks of honour and nobility in his breaſt; neither was it his own aſſumation or brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that made it known, but by an extraordinary way, and contrary to his deſire. And why is it not a likely matter (I pray) that a Prince ſhould ſuffer ſuch common diſaſters as ſhipwrack, and cauſial exil? And what if he ſhew no deſire to return, being at ſuch a vaſt diſtance from his Countrey, and which cannot be effected without apparent danger of his life? what and if he had no ſuch ambitious mind, but had rather ſerve the Queen, than
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:51633:146"/> rule in his own Countrey, muſt he for this be defamed, and not counted what he is? I am ſure that as yet we have not found the leaſt cauſe, but that we ſhould believe him, and therefore I know no reaſon why we ſhould not. But however grant it were as my Lord <hi>Mauriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ia</hi> would have us believe, and that there were ſuch diſparity as he ſpeaks of, yet that diſparity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might not be any obſtacle to agreement in affections, as he would make us believe. For the Queen I make no doubt will reſolve to love, and obey (as duty requires) him whom we ſhall chooſe, and therefore it's but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing thoſe noble vertues of our queen, to ſuppoſe that ſhe ſhould be ſo full of pride and diſobedience, as not to yield to him and the lawes of the gods, being they require it. If then ſhe love him whom we chuſe, you need not fear but that amity, concord and peace will continue, they being altogether maintained by love, There is no fear then that ſhe will think either of his inferiority, or her greatneſs, but of her place and duty; Love is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of obedience, for who obeys the gods better than thoſe who love them? neither fear or honour can beget ſo true obedience as love; the other are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, this free and ingenuous. There is then no fear of thoſe diſunions, disjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſagreements which he imagins, Love being the conjoyner; no fear that ſhe will uſurp more authority over him than is meet, and that ſhe hath gained over his affection: But theſe are vain and idle ſuppoſitions; for may not the gods cauſe a diſunion and disjunction where they pleaſe? Theſe things muſt be left to them, who take a ſpecial regard over Princes and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, placing titular <hi>Demons</hi> or inferior ſpirits for their ſafeties. If they are minded to unite hearts for the proſperity and felicity of a kingdome, what diſparity can be an obſtacle? but if they will diſunite and disjoyn the hearts of the Princes for a plague to us, what love can bind? For this we ſhould make our dayly orations, this ſhould be the ſubject of our prayers and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to the gods, that they would continue their unity and concord. In the the next place my Lord was much beſides himſelf, in ſaying <hi>Araterus</hi> was one of whom we have had but ſmall experience. I wonder what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience he would have, can there be greater than we have had? can there be more? Hath he not given us an eſſay of his valour, prudence, magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, policy, courage and animoſity? Hath he not been ſufficiently truſted with the Army, with the Navey, with the City? what miſchief might he have done us, had he been falſe? how beneficial hath he been to this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? and how much experience have we had of him? what greater would he have? what greater can he have? and yet this man tells us, that he is one that we have had ſmall experience of, when for this two years he hath been ſufficiently employed by the Queen, who with all others that are, not as malicious as himſelf, have had ſufficient experience of his vertues and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity. I am ſorry I have ſaid ſo much to evince a truth ſo obvious, and which in ſpite of envy, himſelf was forc'd to confeſs, when he goes to eclipſe his valour: What, and every good Captain, may not make a good King? yet 'tis requiſite that every good King ought to be a good Captain; and he that proves fortunate in the field, is moſt likely to prove fortunate in the Throne; and he that is bad in the Camp, is not likely to prove good in the Court. Their diſcipline is not ſo far different as he imagins, and though it be granted, that he who knowes how to rule an Army, may not know how to govern a Kingdome: I am ſure he that knowes not how to to govern an Army, cannot rule a Kingdome: for how can he that cannot rule few, govern a multitude? Is it not moſt likely, that he which can rule himſelf, ſhould rule others; and he which can govern an Army, govern a Kingdom. How can he which cannot rule himſelf, govern a family? How can he which cannot govern a family, rule a City? And how can he which cannot govern a City, rule a Province? So how can he which cannot rule an Army, govern a
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:51633:147"/> kingdome? But <hi>Araterus</hi> can tell how to rule an Army, therefore we have no fear but that he knowes how to govern a Kingdome. He hath ſhewed himſelf valiant in the Camp, and therefore moſt likely to ſhew himſelf wiſe in the Court. And truly good Kings ought to be good Captains: for where a good Captain comes to be a King, there moſt commonly is the beſt Government, for he which cannot rule few, can never govern a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; At laſt he would fain inſinuate into us a Maxime of policy fram'd to beat down aſpiring minds: That Princes were only indued with a capacity from the gods to rule, others to obey; which I deny, and though it be little to the purpoſe I cannot let it paſs unanſwered. I could ſtop his mouth thus by telling him that <hi>Araterus</hi> was a Prince, and therefore by his own Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime of a capacity to reign. But the falſity is ſo perſpicuous, that I need but mention to you the experience we have had of many Princes about us, that have lacked a capacity to rule, and of others far from the line of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which have received their Titles and Kingdomes, and have not only had the capacity to rule, but to rule well. Is the gods inſpiration into Princes any other than education? They having a greater means to beget Majeſty and magnanimity, knowing (beſides the excellency of Teachers) that they are born to a Crown, and to rule. And were they ignorant of their birth, and not nurſed up in thoſe princely employments, we ſhould ſee that the gods inſpiration is ſecondary through education. But again, my Lord miſtakes to think we would make our Queen mercenary; we know he hath merited much, and he hath been well rewarded, and we know his modeſty would not have accepted the honours the Queen hath given him, neither is it his ſeeking, nor our deſire as he thinks to reward his deſerts with the Queen and kingdome: But that my Lord might ſee that he hath the art to continue its happineſs and peace. Alas! how weak hath he ſhewed himſelf in repine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Araterus</hi>'s valour, when the enemies themſelves acknowledge it! And though he pleads that his praiſe was againſt equity and Juſtice, I never heard him yet ſuperlaudated, nor did <hi>I</hi> hear any aſcribe more to him than he deſerved. Shall we repine at the valour of a man though it eclips'd that of the <hi>Sornalians,</hi> ſo long as it was for their ſafety and welfare? is this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to equity and juſtice? is this his beſt gratification for his being inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in ſaving the Kingdome and us? What if he beat not the <hi>Sornalions</hi> himſelf? He cannot deny but that he was the chief cauſe of their overthrow: what if many others ventured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their lives as freely? what if they were not equally rewarded? was there any that did deſerve it? I believe though, that none returned with life from the wars ever complained to him, or any elſe of the ingratitude of the Queen, or that they were not ſatisfied. But <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi>'s glory is too ſplendent to be eclipſed with this durt. What he is pleaſed to reflect upon me, I value it not, though it be contrary to the uſe and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of this place to move ſecret ſuſpition: If he thinks me guilty of any thing worthy condemnation, let him accuſe me, according to the way and order of our Lawes. For I proteſt <hi>I</hi> do it not in any way of gratification to <hi>Araterus:</hi> for that life which I confeſs I hold from his valour, but that I think in my conſcience it will be for the happineſs and proſperity of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Alas! what avails it to be vertuous, ſince it cannot ſhelter from the Calumniator? How wickedly and maliciouſly goes he about to defame <hi>Arate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and to make all thoſe vertues he is indued with to be the effects of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation. I need not go about to clear him, ſince he is ſo well known to you all, and I verily believe none of you had ſuch thoughts of him, as my Lord <hi>Mauriſhia.</hi> His ſuppoſitions are ſo far from reaſon, that it would be a folly to anſwer them; thoſe vertues which <hi>Araterus</hi> exhibited, are ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and natural, that thoſe who ſee not with the eye of malice, may know that they are not fain'd or forc'd. I know you could not but ſmile, that my
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:51633:147"/> Lord ſhould go about to make you believe that Princes could not diſſemble as well as other men. I wonder what was his reaſon to ſay ſo, when in my mind they have moſt reaſon of all to diſſemble. Is it not often ſeen that the vices of Princes, before they have come to the Crown, have given cauſe to others to uſurp their places, and to repell them from their rights, the people never pitying the vicious? Had not a vicious Prince then need to cloke and palliate his vices for fear, leſt they might alienate him from the hearts of the people, and make them glad to imbrace any opportunity of depriving him of ruling, rather than ſubject themſelves to one who ſhews himſelf ſo vicious before he attains his power? Is it not for this very reaſon that many Princes have diſſembled, and palliated their evil natures till they have attained their aims, and have been able to warrant their enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities? My Lord tells us too, that many are courteous, generous, good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a meaner condition, but that dignities and places change their hearts and diſpoſitions: Will he exclude Princes from this change too? do not we frequently ſee that good Princes have become very evil and vicious Kings? Why then muſt we needs expect the Prince to prove the ſame with a King, and have not the like thoughts for <hi>Araterus?</hi> In the next place, my Lord miſtakes, and would fain draw you into an error, to inſinuate that the Queen limitted us to her ſutors, or neighbour Princes; No, ſhe gave us our liberty to elect any whom we pleaſed, and thought moſt convenient for the good of the Common-wealth, whether of the Princes or Nobility. My Lord need not ſpeak of the Queens diſhonouring her ſelf by ſo mean conjunction, being that it is not ſo. But if't were, that were a thing incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to the good and benefit of a Kingdom, and the Queen ſhews her exceſs of love to the people, in accepting one, though mean, if choſe by you for the good of the Kingdome; and in this ſhe doth moſt worthy of her ſelf and place, regarding the good of her people before any thing elſe in the world. I would not have you think, that the Queen is not ſo weak as not to ſtand to what you do, or if you ſhould nominate <hi>Araterus</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the liberty ſhe hath given you; No, I believe ſhe will ſtand to your election, and rather accept of him than any other whom ſhe hath partly denyed. Do you not think the people would be glad of ſuch a Soveraign as <hi>Araterus,</hi> whom they ſo much affect, under whoſe banner they fought couragiouſly, and came off victoriouſly; one whom they never accounted among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but rather for the Majeſty he bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That although he were a ſtranger by birth, yet that they had full tryal and experience of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and that having learnt their language and manners, the Queen had made him as one of the Countrey. That ſhe had honoured him, and ſtiled him with the Title of Prince, ſo that he would be no diſhonour to the

That vertue was more to be conſidered than any other thing, yet in him they would find youth, beauty, courage, prudence, magnanimity, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, and every thing that ſhould accompany a Prince. That they ſhould be mindfull of what he had done for the Countrey, and obſerve the hand of the gods, who by things ſo unuſual, had brought him from his own Countrey, oppos'd him to hazards and dangers, and all as it were purpoſely for their ſafe-guard: ſo that the gods themſelves, as it were, had elected him, and that it would be no part of their wiſdomes to reſiſt the hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

                        <p>Things being brought to this iſſue, <hi>Mauriſhia</hi> ſeeing it concluded, thought it no policy to gain <hi>Araterus</hi>'s disfavour by not ſubjecting to him. He no ſooner crav'd his pardon, but it was granted with a great deal of freedome and obligement. <hi>Araterus</hi> and the Queen conſpired in their joyes, and there was nothing now that could prove any obſtacle to the fruition of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces: But leſt fortune might turn her wheel, and daſh all their joyes with ſome croſs, as ſhe uſually doth; they determined the time for <hi>Arateruus</hi>'s marriage and coronation. That time at laſt came, and it was effected in the City of <hi>Sinda</hi> very celebriouſly, and with much rejoycing. The City ecchoed with long-live <hi>Araterus</hi> King of <hi>Sornalia,</hi> and his fair Queen <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marillis,</hi> and every part of it ſhone with fires of rejoycing. It was every way glorious, and graced with domeſtick and neighbour Princes, who with the ſtatelineſs of their trains, added luſtre to the <hi>Hymenaean</hi> triumph. There was all manner of triumps, turnies, balls and ſports exhibited after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Countrey, which laſted for many dayes without intermiſſion. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe rejoycings and ſports had expired their time, and that <hi>Araterus</hi> had ſufficiently taſted the pleaſures of his bride, he betook him to graver and weightier affairs; as in ſetling the Kingdome, making of Lawes, ordaining of Councels, rewarding his friends; all which he effected with ſo much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and prudence, that his very enemies were forc'd to confeſs, that he was worthy of the dignity he had gain'd. After a years injoyment of all the happineſſes and bliſſes heaven can afford on earth. I ſolicited <hi>Araterus</hi> to let me return, that I might bring you the tidings of his felicity; but he unwilling to part with me, cauſed me to marry, which he thought would be a ſufficient tye to keep me there. Indeed it was ſo, for having a wife and children, I was engag'd to continue there; and under the bounties of <hi>Araterus</hi> I liv'd all my dayes with content and pleaſure. <hi>Araterus</hi> had a very fair iſſue by his Queen, all partaking of the external and internal bleſſings of their parents. In ſo many years there was not the leaſt difference, nor a ceſſion of thoſe flames that poſſeſt them in their youth.</p>

I know not what it was, but I am ſure all the pleaſures that I there injoyed, could not utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh that Love I had to my own Countrey, and deſire that I had to ſee it.

This made me diſpoſe of many of thoſe ſervants that came with me, keeping but a few of them; and knowing a truſty f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All the perſwaſions of my friends could not detain me from ſeeking you, which I did, help'd alſo by my friends, enquiring through all the Neighbour Countries, Cities and Towns, but after many moneths ſearch in vain, I returned, not ſo much as hearing any newes of you. To content my friends, I ſtayed almoſt a year with them; but not enjoying my ſelf without you, I took a ſpecial care to ſecure that treaſure which <hi>I</hi> preſerv'd ſtill untouch'd for you, which being laid up ſafe, without the knowledge of any of my friends, I departed, having vowed never to return, till I had either found you out, or heard cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of your death. Having in this reſolution ſearched through all <hi>Cilicia, Capadocia, Paphlagonia,</hi> and through all the leſſer <hi>Aſia;</hi> I paſſed over to <hi>Greece,</hi> and ſearching thorow all thoſe Provinces in vain, I returned to <hi>Aſia</hi> again ſorrowfull and dejected: But coaſting all long <hi>Pontus,</hi> and viſiting theſe parts, <hi>I</hi> fell very dangerouſly ſick, when meeting with the man you found tormenting me, whoſe name is <hi>Proculus,</hi> he very generouſly, after ſome ſmall acquaintance conducted me to his houſe, which is not far from this place, where <hi>I</hi> indured a ſharp and tedious ſickneſs, but ſo carefully and tenderly looked after by him, that I was in an eſpecial manner engaged to him. After I began to be well, not believing any thing had been able to ſhake that love in him which I had beheld ſo ſtrong, <hi>I</hi> gave him (to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him) the beſt relation of all my paſt adventures. But O the power of that <hi>Stygian</hi> vice, avarice, which is able to convert love into hatred, and make friends turn foes, and take away that life which they have preſerved: This was the cauſe of my ſtripes and tormenting, for he having heard of the Treaſure which <hi>I</hi> brought with me, (for <hi>I</hi> concealed not any thing from him) it ſo troubled and tormented his mind, that he could not be ſatisfied without it, ſuch was his thirſt of gain. He at firſt ſought by all fly and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning means to pump of me in what place <hi>I</hi> had hid it, and whom <hi>I</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with it, his enquiry made me miſtruſt him, and <hi>I</hi> was now very ſorry
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:51633:149"/> that I had ſpoken any rhing of it, my heart miſgiving me ſome diſaſter, ſo that his inquiries were in vain, for I ſtill left him unſatisfied. But when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that <hi>I</hi> grew well, and that <hi>I</hi> was about to leave him, he in plaine terms told me, that he muſt know where the Treaſure was, counſelling me to devide it betwixt us, ſeeing you, (as he ſaid) after ſo many years ſearch not heard of, were in all likelyhood dead and rotten, ſo that it belonged to me, and to him in preſerving my life. But when he ſaw threats would not do, he ſought to extort it out of me by torments, which he alſo found too weak to break my reſolution, for he had in that place which you found me in, in the like manner tormented me thrice before, which ſo enraged him, that he had ſworn <hi>I</hi> ſhould never return to his houſe alive, if <hi>I</hi> would not confeſs it to him, which <hi>I</hi> reſolved not to do, though <hi>I</hi> had ſuffered an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred deaths: And <hi>I</hi> verily believe he would have been as good as his word, if that the gods miraculouſly had not ſent you to my relief, and out of ſuch afflictions brought me to my inveſtigated happineſs. A happineſs <hi>I</hi> have ſought for this five years, it being ſo much ſince <hi>I</hi> returned out of the Eaſt, therefore it cannot repent me of my torments, which hath been the means to my finding of my Maſter. <hi>Meador</hi> thus ended his narration, which had given great content to the Princeſſes to hear <hi>Araterus</hi>'s ſtory, to end with ſo much pleaſure and ſolace. But the day beginning to decline after they had engaged <hi>Euripedes</hi> and <hi>Lonoxia</hi> to viſit them at their Caſtle, they departed. The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioter being returned to the entrance of the grove, according as they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, the Princeſſes mounted their Chariot, and <hi>Tribulus</hi> and <hi>Argelois</hi> their horſes, which being done, they preſently arrived at the Caſtle, whoſe Gates ſtood wide open to receive the beauties and the glories of the Eaſt.</p>
